Website: http://www.anglinglines.com/Alder/

Description: Alder Lake is a mature lake dating back to the 1960s. It is set in the centre of 150 acres of Limousin farmland and trees. Check out the aerial view on Google Maps, and you’ll see there are no roads, railways or pylons close by. All our visitors comment about the beautiful and peaceful countryside. The lake is 10 acres in size and can be booked by up to 5 anglers giving a massive 2 acres of space per person (at least). The lake is set in the centre of France, but thanks to the great motorway network it is only 5½ hours from Caen

Lake: This beautiful lake is set in a natural bowl and fringed by mature oaks, chestnuts and alders. It is fed by two streams on either flank of the isthmus giving two sets of features, one on each side. The overhanging trees on the isthmus provide plenty of snags and cover and are great fish holding areas. The rest of the lake is snag free. It has a stony bottom with silt channels following the old stream beds. The pegs are cut between the trees giving plenty of cover. Depths range from shallows to 15ft, and there are no weed problems.

Facilities: Because Alder is set in the middle of glorious unspoilt countryside it’s not possible to connect it up to mains electricity or water, so the facilities are basic and environmentally sensitive. The toilet system was purchased from Canada where the provision of hygiene services in the arctic wilderness is a problem long since solved! A low flush self cleaning toilet leads to a bio-digester which in the long term generates compost. The low flush volume is provided by a bucket of lake water and no fossil fuel is burnt to provide it!

In a separate cabin there is a gas cooker. Fresh water is fetched down from the owners farm house in containers. Lighting is currently provided by gas lamps (these will eventually be superseded by solar powered lights).

The main toilet, shower and freezer facilities are located at the owner’s farm which is about a 5 minute walk away.4:T63c,Location : Limousin region of South-West France

Description:

The lake is about 13 acres in size, which has been established approximately 18 years. During the last few years, Mr. Dollat (Mayor of Perigny la Rose) with his team have refurnished this pit and made all the banks available for fishing. The lake is totally secured with a fence covering the full 15 acres of land. There is a track that goes all around the perimeter. The swims are well spaced out, with grassy areas for bivvies and rods. The banks are very smooth, which give you the opportunity to fish anywhere you like.

The lake bed, in true gravel pit style, is anything but flat with gravel bars, deep holes and plateaus all over the place. Bait boats are allowed on this venue and could be an advantage for precise baiting and presentation. There is not a lot of weed – a big head of grass carp do a good job at keeping it at bay.

The lake has a very big head of carp that was stocked bi-annually by the mayor of Périgny la Rose until 2008. One of the nice things about the venue is the high proportion of commons present – the lake record common stands at 55lb.

The average size is between 32lb – 35lb, with mirrors and over 55lb having been banked. There is a very healthy head of 30-35-pounds carp.

In January 2010, another ton of fish, commons, mirrors and linears to over 30lbs were added by us to boost the original stockb:T4d0,Location : Le Man Website: http://www.bountylemans.com/fishingholidays.html

The fishery is set in a thirty acre estate and covers twenty four acres of water.

The complex is set to a backdrop of woodland providing a quiet and relaxing atmosphere and is totally private and secure. The lakes cover various levels of carp angling offering all aspects from a runs water to harder lakes with larger fish for the more dedicated angler.

The site provides a relaxing holiday partly due to our policy of only having a limited number of anglers per week, allowing everyone the opportunity to move swims or lakes during their stay if they wish. Since we have owned the lakes there has been a continuous programme of works to improve the complex for both the anglers and our fish. This has consisted of desilting them, adding features and improving the stock levels of fish.

There is a fully equipped shower and toilet facilities located on the outside of the house and these are connected to all main services.

The complex is located in a small hamlet, about 5 minutes from the local town that provides all amenities including supermarkets, bars and banks.

Description:

The lake at Carp and Cats is a well established haven for fish. Formerly owned by a French family who used it as their holiday home. It seems though that no fishing ever took place. Rumour has it that the French only fish to eat and not for pleasure so they missed out on the joys of sitting on these sleepy banks with a rod in hand.

The lake is three acres in size, set in ten acres of beautiful tranquil and secluded woodland, all of which is securely fenced but with easy vehicle access. It is fed by several natural springs with varying depths to cater for all types of angling. Ideally suited to four anglers with a maximum of six permitted. There is a small island adorned by one of many beautiful overhanging silver birch trees making an ideal spot to fish to. You may prefer to stalk in the margins or fish our open water. All of this is possible here. The hard bottom of the lake combined with gravel bars allows perfect bait presentation. For the less mobile angler, the flat banks are ideal for easy access. With depths ranging from 18 inches to 14 feet with no snags the lake is perfect for any type of fishing. All of these features will add to the fun of fishing at the Carp and Cats location.

Stock:The lake is stocked with the highest quality carp – sourced from the most reputable fish farmer in France. There is a mixture of commons and mirrors, including plenty of hard fighting virgin carp up to 40lbs+. There is also a large head of catfish up to 61lbs+, with none less than late doubles. We have a large stock pond and two basins that enable us to keep the fish population at an optimum level for all of our anglers. This will ensure you don’t go short of a decent run or two.

Facilities:Luxury Chalet

Nestling on the bank of the lake our luxury IRM chalet provides excellent accommodation for up to six people. It offers two double bedrooms (one with a double bed, the other with twin beds) and a double pull out sofa in the lounge area. It also has a bathroom and separate toilet and a well equipped kitchen. It is furnished to a high standard with almost every modern comfort you could wish for. In addition it benefits from an outside terrace with table and chairs where you can relax and enjoy the beautiful views over the lake.

Tepee with Fire Pit

Description: An exclusive 3 acre carp venue in Brittany France only 90 minutes from the ferry ports. Carp Quarry has been set up for the discerning anglers who want peace and tranquillity at a truly stunning venue with top quality carp fishing where you and your party have exclusive use of the 3 bedroom gite/cottage and the lake.

Lake: Carp Quarry is a very old deep granite quarry which closed in 1938 and now fills from underground springs. This 3 acre lake truly is one of the most unusual stunning fishing venues in France. To the far side of the lake rising from the water are 100 ft granite cliffs which are home to many birds of prey. The swims are along one side of the lake which have been excavated to make large comfortable swims where it is possible to cast over to the overhanging trees on the cliff face opposite. The lake which is set in its own grounds has a large lockable gated entrance. You can park your car within the lake complex giving you total privacy. No permits are required and fishing is permitted day and night. We recommend 4 persons fishing but can accommodate up to 6. The lake is very deep with mainly a rock and gravel bottom with a few silty areas.

Stock: We have just stocked in excess of a ton of fish supplied by a local fish farmer in the winter of 2008. The smallest of these fish being 23lb up to the mid 40's with the average fish being nearly 30lb. These are the quick growing large framed royal strain mainly mirrors with a few common, to complement the existing fish stocks. The lake was stocked with carp and trout by the previous owner in 1995 but was only fished for trout up until the year 2000, since then it has been left untouched. The lake dates back to 1938 when it stopped production as a quarry. It holds a good head of wild carp as well as the original mirrors and commons which we know very little about but have heard stories about monster commons. We have seen one of them that looked in excess of 50lb, so the lake may produce one or two surprises. There are also very nice trout, rudd and perch with the odd large pike. There are crayfish in the lake but these do not cause a problem to the fishing as the large carp eat them as soon as they appear.

Facilities: The accommodation is a detached 3 bedroom house situated 150yrds up the road from the lake (just a 2 minute walk), you can park at the gite and also at the lakeside. All 3 bedrooms have twin beds, there is a well equipped kitchen/diner with washing machine dishwasher cooker microwave fridge freezer etc and a large separate lounge with large log burner, tv/dvd and a bait fridge freezer. There is also a large patio with table and chairs. The bathroom has a bath with shower over.10:T503,Description: Carp Heaven is a beautiful and very tranquil tree lined lake of almost 15 acres (6 hectares) located in the Burgundy region of France. It is surrounded by woods and pastures grazed by the local white charolais cows. The depth varies from just under 3ft at the shallow end and it gets deeper towards the dam wall where it has depths of up to 8ft with the average of about 5ft. The shallows covers an area of about 4 acres and is an area that the fish love to sunbathe and feed and has 8 islands and 3 swims. The main area of the lake has 11 swims, many of which are doubles. The bottom is a sandy/clay which is quite common with many French lakes and there is very little weed. The lake was emptied in November 2006 when virtually 100% of the snags were removed. The longest cast required is only about 90 - 100 yd's so rods of 2.75lb test with fully loaded bait runners and 2.5oz leads should get you anywhere on this lake and bait boats are permitted. At more than 1/4 mile long, new clients pull into the car park and are delighted to see the lake stretching out before them. There is a fantastic mixture of wildlife that visits the lake including Deer, Golden Orielles, Hoopies, Buzzards, Kingfishers, Storks, Egrets, Red Squirrels, Pine Martins etc,etc.

Whilst other venues occasionally steal the limelight, Cassien is always at the hearts of serious carp anglers and just to walk the banks of this incredible venue is a privilege. Catching form there is a dream. We are the only company to offer holidays to this fantastic location which basks in the sunshine near to Nice in the south of France.

We've got the rest, and it's exactly the sort of kit that you need.

If you want to experience Cassien at its best then look no further. This is the place for you.

You fly into Nice airport with one of the cheapy airlines (Easyjet and BMI fly to Nice from the UK for less than a hundred quid) and we'll pick you up from the airport and take you to our base 10 minutes from the lake.

What's Included?

What do we need to bring:

You stay on a fantastic camp site a few minutes away from Cassien and we take you down to the lake and bring you back every day.

Included in the price is tented accommodation but you can upgrade to either a mobile home or a chalet for a small charge should you so wish. A lot of guys like to bring their wives' or girlfriends with them and we would suggest an upgrade in this circumstance for extra privacy.

Booking information:http://www.castawaylake.co.uk14:T6c9,Description: Cedar is a mature gravel pit of around 4 acres in size which has 2 lakeside wooden chalets, both with their own fishing platforms. 4 anglers can hire the whole lake exclusively, including both chalets, but we also accept bookings from 2 pairs of anglers – each pair having use of one of the chalets.

Lake: 4 acres in size and has 4 swims. Cedar is set in its own very private grounds, securely fenced in and separated from the road by the large Cedar trees from which it takes its name. The owners, Tommy and George Young, know what’s needed to produce a first class fishery, both in terms of carp stock and facilities, and they will spare no expense to do it... so you can be confident that Cedar is a top quality venue

Facilities: They have installed two new wooden chalets on opposite banks of the lake, each having steps down to its own large, comfortable fishing platform. Each chalet has electricity, a fridge and cooking facilities and will comfortably sleep 2 people in 2 single beds (no bedding is supplied at all – please bring your own pillows, sleeping bags etc). At present there is no mains water available in the chalets but there is a refillable water tank to provide water for washing up etc. The newly built toilet and shower block does have mains water and drainage and is housed in a separate cabin on the third bank, a couple of minutes walk from either chalet. Access by car is possible to both chalets.

Because of the steps down to the fishing platforms from the chalets it would be too dangerous to allow fishing from the chalet i.e. you must be down on the platform with your rods if they are fishing. There’s plenty of room to bivvy up on the platforms so night fishing is not a problem.15:T7ad,Location: Chateau de Tigny is a 16th century French Bourguignon style castle with a 12 acre lake which is set in a beautiful rural backdrop situated near the attractive market town, Charlieu, Loire, in the Rhone-Alps Region of France.

Description:The 12 Acre Lake offers a no snag gravel base with a light silt bed. Once you have hooked, you can play the fish in complete confidence your line will not get snapped up on any under water obsticles. In 2007 the lake was drained and re-stocked with over 1ton of Mirror Carp, Common Carp and Grass Carp weighing up to 45lb. They put up a good fight! which makes Chateau de Tigny the most desirable place for Carp fishing in France!

There is also the drive & survive option for the keen angler with facilities provided in the Chateau that comprise of a kitchen, shower & toilet. See the Fishing section of our website for more information.

Chateau de Tigny is also a great venue for painters. Located on the 29 Acre grounds is a pigeonnair, an old mill, The Devil's Bridge, the lake and of course The Chateau itself, which all lend themselves as excellent subjects for artists.

Stock:Winter 2008 the lake was drained and re-stocked with Common Carp up to 45lb, Mirror Carp up to 39lb and Grass Carp up to 25lb. There has been over 1 ton of Carp added into this lake. An average Carp here weighs around 25lb+.

Website: http://www.chestnutlakefrance.com/

Description: Chestnut Lake is situated in a tiny hamlet in the heart of the Limousin region just 20 miles north of the city of Limoges, the Limousin capital. We have a total of 12 acres consisting of an ancient five and half acre lake surrounded by large lawns and a private woodland.

It is therefore a well established lake and for that reason we have tried our best not to change or disturb it. All the banks surrounding the lake are low and are therefore easy accessible for both catching and returning.

Facilities: Just behind the chalet there are laundry facilities and an extra freezer / fridge should you require this.

On the land we have built a children’s play area with a large wooden frame housing a tree cabin with a slide and swings . There is a wooden wendy house which has footballs , frisbees , bats , balls , skipping ropes and many more to amuse the the children or even some adults ! There is an 18FT diameter above ground swimming pool with steps to climb in surrounded by a decking area . There is a covered Table Tennis table and also a Badminton net , with all the rackets , bats and balls provided .

All of this is situated in front of the chalet so you can relax while the children play for hours.

By the home there is a bbq area with tables and chairs for those long summer days and nights or take a walk in the woods and through the paths we have cut away and watch the wildlife or just listen to the birds.17:Tb53,Location: Situated a few kilometers from Reims in Northern France

Description: Coelacanthe, also known as “The Village”. This lake beats everybody’s expectations in terms of lake quality, fish stocking, facilities and service. Every detail is looked after and the owners have managed to create a five star carp fishing venue. If you’re looking for a luxury Carp fishing holiday – for the same price as other lakes – choose Coelacanthe! The Lake: This former gravel pit has a surface of 17 hectares. The bottom is fairly flat with no holes and the maximum depth is about 2,40 m. The margins drop off very quickly. There’s no weed formation during the hotter months, and there’s no Poisson chat at all. The bottom is mainly gravel with a little silt. The property has a secure perimeter and the entrance door is closed at night, which will give you a safe feeling. Notice the presence of mussels and crayfish. On the far end of the venue you can find the restaurant that has a fantastic view over the lake. The owner’s house is situated next to it. The Swims: The Lake is equally dotted with 7 single swims and 7 double swims. The singles are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12. The doubles are 1, 3, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16. If you book two single swims for two anglers, you can still sit together in one of them and the other swim won’t be rented. All swims have good car access and you can park your car behind the swim. Just swims 14, 15 and 16 have no car access. The spacious swims are surrounded by lots of vegetation, which can provide you with enough shade in the summer. Boats are not allowed, but bait boats are. Placing of hook links is allowed but with restrictions. During the briefing, every angler will know exactly where he or she can fish up to, this is done to avoid crossing lines and to prevent jealous anglers from fishing on your hot spots. Every lake has its mythical swims where one catches presumably more fish, but the owner informed us that the fish are all over the lake. Ask Mr. Noll, the owner, about the hot spot of your swim… The Fish Stocks: Everybody knows that building a healthy carp stocking is difficult and takes a lot to time. It took 10 years to build the amazing Coelacanthe carp population of which 50% of the fish weigh over 15kg. You’ll catch mirrors, leathers, fully scales and commons. Every week a 20kg+ is landed and the lake record is 28,600 kg (2006). The 2009 lake record was a 26kg carp. The most exciting story of the 2009 season was an angler that caught 3 carp over 20 kg in less than 45 minutes! Besides carp you can also catch bass, sander, pike and catfish (over 100kg!). The Facilities: The facilities of Coelacanthe have a hygiene level of a five star hotel. Even your mother wouldn’t mind taking a shower. They charge 2 euros every time you have a shower, but it’s worth it!

Website: http://www.bigotlakes.co.uk/commons

Description: He’s replicated Morganes as closely as possible – a lake you book exclusively for up to 6 anglers, complete with mobile home accommodation and stuffed full of large, pristine carp. Morganes is virtually booked out 12 months in advance so we had no reason to suspect that Commons would not be the same... and so it’s proved.

Lake: Around 3 acres in size the lake is roughly square in shape. Overall depth is fairly shallow with an average of 1.5m to the left, shallowing up to around 1m on the right hand side. The lake bed while silty is fairly firm and clear. There are no snags or weed beds, but the far and right hand margins have over hanging trees that act as good holding areas for the carp. Access is possible to the mobile home by car and on foot all around the venue. The right hand side is flanked by fields and fishing is not possible from this bank.

Stock: Like its sister lakes, Morganes & Margot, Commons Lake is owned by one of France’s largest fish farmers, Michel Bigot, so the fish stocks are excellent. As its names suggests, the stock consist of 80% common carp and these include several 40lb+ specimens – a relative rarity in most lakes. The majority of the carp are twenties and thirties and there are a number of 40lb+ mirrors too. Catches of 60+ fish in the week are common... and 100+ not unknown!

Other species include around 15 catfish to nearly 60lb, several of which are the rare Mandarin variety. There’s also a large diamond backed sturgeon of around 55lb. In total the stock numbers over 120 fish, ensuring excellent action as well as the possibility of banking a few superb specimens.

Facilities: When you book this lake you get full use of the mobile home which sits right at the water’s edge. It has a fully fitted kitchen (with fridge freezer, cooker and oven), shower and toilet with hot water. There’s one double bedroom and one bedroom suitable for children with two bunk style beds. The living room sofas also double as single beds for two people. The living area has both UK and French wall sockets installed. This is basic accommodation – if you take partners and they’re looking for a bit of luxury they would be disappointed – but as a shelter and cooking station for anglers it’s perfect!

Outside the mobile home is decking and a shelter with garden furniture that provides a perfect social areas while fishing the near bank.19:T674,Location: It is located in the beautiful department of Aisne in Picardy northeast France just 3 hours from Calais.

Website: http://www.cretelakes.com/index.php

Description: These former gravel pits were created about 25 years ago and were stocked with carp and other course fish around this time. Carp fishing at the venue commenced in November 2008 and early indications suggest there are many big carp already present with fish to 50+ already landed. These carp have been left to thrive in there natural environment without fishing pressure for two decades! In the winter of 2008/2009.

Stock: we added a further 850 carp to forty pound, all uncaught mirrors from one of the best sources in France. We believe that added to the original stock Cretelakes will be among the very best carp fishing lakes France has to offer. In March 2010 we will be running organized all inclusive coach trips to and from Cretelakes with food packages included.

Lakes: Cretelakes is a beautiful 4 lake venue set in 60 acres. The French carp fishing lakes are former gravel pits dug around 25 years ago and around this time they were stocked with carp and other course fish.

Website: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=10

In the Oise Valley, Northern France, lies Domaine de la Vallée, a marvelous lake that has become a fantastic Carp Fishing Venue. It’s a large, varied venue with lots of islands, bays, lily pads and overhanging trees that provide plenty of challenges. The swims can be booked for weekends, weeks or midweeks.

The Lake

Domaine de la Vallée has a total surface of 50 hectares (123 acres). Old trees and extensive fields surround the lake. Main features are islands, bays, overhanging trees and lily pads that provide plenty of challenges. In the northern part of the lake, a stream flows into the lake and provides plenty of oxygen, and natural food. This explains also why this part of the lake is colder and has clearer water. The fish, however, prefer the southern part with warmer water and more plankton. The bottom is irregular and has a soft layer of silk. Apart from the lilies, there are no obstacles. The depth varies between 0,50 m and 4 m.

The swims 1 to 12 lie in the southern part of the lake. Swims 7 to 11 are closed by the end of August due to the duck hunt that is organized there. This is not dangerous, but can be annoying. Swim 3 is located on a small island and provides interesting fishing possibilities. Swims 4 and 5 are very popular and a good choice for groups of 3 or 4 anglers. Swims 1 and 2 are spacious and deeper water; the car can be parked close to these swims. Swims 7+9 are interesting for a group of 3 anglers, whereas peg 8 is a good double swim. The swims on the island only have access by boat. You can bring your own boat or rent a boat on the site (8 euros per day). Bait boats are also allowed and so is placing off hook links and ground feeding with a boat.

Domaine de la Vallée has an unknown, old stock of carp up to 50 pounds. The owners restocked the lake several times with younger animals. There’s plenty of natural food (crayfish, mussels, etc) and the carp are growing steadily. The bigger carp are not so easy to catch, but every good angler will catch some stunning carp.

The venue has a decent sanitary block with showers, washbasins and toilets. There are also 2 fridges, a freezer and a microwave oven for the anglers

Website: http://www.domaine-des-iles.com

Description: Take a drive into the heart of Picardie, Northern France, and experience the delights of Le Domain des iles. The 60 acres of water on this private estate plays host to about 1,000 specimen carp up to 66lbs, with almost one hundred in the 40 to 60lb bracket. The complex, which is located within the most gorgeous settings, consists of three lakes which originally where all connected to each other by channels where the carp could move from lake to lake, however to enhance the quality of the fishing the channels have been blocked off so that we can offer different styles of fishing.

The Main LAKE: The main lake is limited to 12 anglers and offers the very realistic chance of some huge fish. There is one main Lodge at the North east end of the lake which when booked includes the 4 swims at that corner of the lake. There are also 2 cabins situated next to each other where it is possible to fish from the cabins. The lake record of 66 pounds is to be found in this lake along with a lot of the other big fish. As an added bonus 152 catfish where stocked into this lake in Jan 2000 ranging from 3 pounds to 30 pounds, and as expected these have piled on the weight pretty rapidly due to the amount of small fish in the lake and are now between 20 and 60 pounds. There are now 6 new benches situated around the main lake with power socket, lights and fridge. There are also lights and power situated in the swims. The lake bottom is clear firm peat and there is no weed to hinder you. Most baits work on this lake but the carp company baits sold on site really go well.

The Back Lake and new lodge: We now have a brand new luxury lodge which offers superb facilities for maximum comfort whilst fishing, including satellite TV, fridge freezer, cooking hob, microwave, large shower, toilet, 3 bedrooms, plates, cutlery, cooking utensils. Why not book the lodge and back lake exclusively and fish your own private estate lake. The back lake is about 7 acres and is limited to 6 anglers, as well as the originals this lake has been stocked with 400 carp to offer some easier fishing. The fish range from doubles to 40 pounds with the odd bigger fish which go up to a verified 52 pound common carp.1e:T725,(Etang de la Barriere, Etang de la Fontaine) Location: Champagne region Website: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=5

Description: Domaine de Brocard is one of our most successful venues in France. No wonder the best pegs are already booked one year in advance. This former hunting domain, with a surface of 300 hectares, consists of 3 lakes surrounded by woodlands. The Lakes: On the first 12 hectare lake (550 m long, 100 wide) a maximum of 8 anglers can enjoy fishing from 4 pegs. They are situated on the south bank where anglers can fish without any possibility of snagging others lines. The gravel path provides good access to the pegs. The lake features over-hanging trees and reed-lined margins and on peg 1 there are some lily pads on the left side. Peg 1 is the only one-angler-peg of the venue. This first lake is stocked with 360 carp between 10 - 55 pounds. Maximum depth is 2 m. In the 2 hectare nurse-pond, fishing is not allowed. The third lake has a surface of 16 hectares and has a good access via a gravel path. Pegs 9 and 10 however can have a more difficult access by car when it rains. The tents stand on wooden pontoons. This lake is not deep, on average there's 1.5 m water and the bottom is soft without obstacles. Between pegs 6 and 7 lies a little island. Swim 12 is new for the 2007 season. Just like the first lake, there are over-hanging trees, reed-lined margins and lily pads in several areas. There are neither freshwater mussels nor crayfish. Take into account that there might be some weed formation when the water gets warmer (end of may, june...). This lake is stocked with 500 carp between 10 and 50 pounds. On the site there's a wooden toilet and in the village at 8 km there are facilities that consist of showers and toilets. Book through: Fishmans Holidays website1f:T2492,DreamLake 1 offers 'specimen style' fishing and regularly produces multiple catches of big-carp up to the mid fifty-pound range. The current records for the lake stand at an impressive 62lb 8oz mirror carp, 70lb 2oz common carp and a 130lb catfish.

A 'square horseshoe' in shape and approx. 15-acres in size, we allow only 15 anglers per week on DreamLake 1 and with 23 well appointed swims to choose from, there is always plenty of space to move around. All of the swims are large, log lined gravelled areas - built by carp anglers for carp anglers. So large bivvies or tents are accommodated comfortably. Steps are thoughtfully placed for ease of access with 12 swims are designated as suitable for disabled/wheelchair angling.

The depth of DreamLake 1 varies between 6-9ft with many features to be found including gravel bars and weedbeds, plus the central spit of land that creates the horshoe shape providing a far-margin feature and bite hotspot. The lake is free from crayfish or poisson chat so common to other French waters - so you do not need to worry about netting hookbaits. The unique shape and layout of DreamLake 1 and positioning of the swims ensures that there is nowhere that you cannot cast too and nowhere for the fish to hide or hold-up out of reach.

With a record haul of 70 carp in one week, 220 carp (weighing in at over two tonnes) were added to the already impressive stock levels during December 2001 - with a further one tonne of new carp introduced in October 2003. A hundred thirty and forty pound carp were then introduced in November 2005 followed by 150 beautifully coloured chestnut mirror carp stocked in Nov 2007. Meaning both big-hit hauls of fish, as well as PB breaking big-carp captures are always on the cards - a uniquely mouthwatering carp fishing situation!

DreamLake 2 offers anglers excellent 'specimen style' fishing providing every chance of hooking into a number of huge carp - with a massive head of twenty and thirty-pound carp backing-up the huge number of forty and fifty-pound fish topped by 60lb specimens!.

The current lake records are 61lb 8oz for common carp, 57lb 12oz for mirror carp, the catfish record stands at 97lb, and 44lb 8oz is the impressive grass carp record - with an arm-aching haul of 93 fish the most recorded by a single angler in one week.

Rectangular in shape and approx. 18-acres in size, we allow only 18 anglers per week on DreamLake 2. The 30 swims are all linked by a gravel track around the lake and with so many pegs to choose from there is always plenty of room to move if you wish. These easily accessible swims are well presented neat, log-lined gravelled areas. Large bivvies or tents are accommodated with ease and a number of swims close to the lodge are designated as suitable for disabled/wheelchair access.

The depth of DreamLake 2 varies between 5-7ft with many underwater features including gravel bars and silt pockets. Again there is no need to worry about protecting hookbaits with mesh, as there are no crayfish or poisson chat that often inhabit other French waters.

The stocking program of DreamLake 2 has seen the impressive head of specimen carp increased many fold over the years. Prior to opening in 1998, DreamLake 2 saw the addition of over five tonnes of carp including twenty forty-pound plus fish to 49lb, over twenty at 38lbs+, over 100 carp of 31lb+ and hundreds at twenty-pound plus. Since then DreamLake 2 simply got better when, in December 2001, a further 200 carp weighing in at over two tonnes including two fifty-pound carp were introduced. More recently, an additional one tonne of carp were added in October 2003, over 200 carp in November 2005 and yet a further 200 beautiful chestnut mirrors in November 2007. All have served to make an excellent water a simply awesome place to fish.

DreamLake 3 opened in May 2000 and has quite simply gone from strength to strength. It's hardly surprising really as two tonnes of carp went into the lake in November 2003 - carp to over fifty-pound including 142 high-twenties, thirties and what we're famous for, numourous carp over the forty-pound mark! The combination of these specimen fish with the 600 carp present for the opening of the lake, as well as other prior stocking periods (100 carp December 2002 and 120 carp to 53lb 8oz introduced in December 2001) makes the over-all biomass of fish in this 8-acre lake quite incredible!

Only available to anglers on our Inclusive Package, DreamLake 3 offers anglers excellent 'action style' sport combined with every chance of a personal best whacker thrown in - the perfect fishing situation. Current records stand at 49lb-12oz for mirror carp, a colossal 81lb 9oz for common carp, the grass carp record is a staggering 56lb and 87lb for cat fish.

The lake itself is mature and tree-lined with 16 neatly presented log fronted swims and all with easy access, meaning DreamLake 3 provides ample room for the maximum of eight anglers accommodated each week. As you'd expect from this style of pit there are numerous gravel features within DreamLake 3, as well as weedbeds found across the depths that vary between 6-9ft. If you're new to DreamLakes, you'll also be pleased to learn that unlike many French waters the lake is free from crayfish or poisson chat - allowing you to maintain confidence in your hookbait without the need for netting or similar protection.

Daily transport at meal times to and from the air-conditioned DreamLake restaurant is provided by your resident team of DreamLake Bailiffs. However, to save a short walk of approx. 1km, DreamLake 3 shares it's own on-site shop, shower and toilet facilities with adjacent DreamLake 4 and DreamLake 5.

The opening of DreamLake 4 in May 2000 saw the addition of over 200 carp to what was already an impressive level of stock. Since then a number of thirty and forty-pound fish have also been introduced, with a further 100 carp to 49lb going into the lake in November 2003. Not forgetting the stocking of 50 carp to 44lb (December 2002) and 40 carp in December 2001 - yes, you've guessed it, DreamLake 4 is set to create even more PB smashing moments for our visitors. There's a few lake records you'd love to see on the mat thats for sure - how about a common carp of 50lb or a mirror carp weighing at 50lb 8oz, not to mention the huge 118lb catfish and 50lb grass carp present.

Mature and tree-lined, this attractive 4-acre lake boasts eight rustic log lined swims - neatly presented and easily accessible, providing ample room for the maximum four anglers accommodated each week or up to six if booked as a group. With various gravel and weedbed features the average depth of DreamLake 4 is around 7-8ft in most places.

Having opened in late March 2004, DreamLake 5 lived-up to all expectations in offering some of the best carp and cat fishing action in France. Not surprising considering over two tonnes of carp to 50lbs, including nearly eighty thirty and forty-pound fish were introduced in Dec 2003. In addition, some of our bigger cats to 120lb+ have also been relocated to the new DreamLake 5. All of these beautiful, pristine looking specimens supplement the huge numbers of high-doubles and twenties, as well as the existing levels of thirties and forties.

Description: Is the jewel in our crown at 11acres; this lake is to be developed at the end of the 2009 season. It has been used as a predator lake being the home to Black Bass, Pike and Zander. It’s stated by visitors that this lake could hold the French record for Black Bass. The lake is totally natural and we have not built any swims on it and allow our clients to bivvy up where they want and try for the unknown.

Lake: At present this lake is yet to be developed, however for the angler that wants to fish the unknown it’s certainly appealing. We are at present unable to say what size the Carp are in this lake as it has not been drained for many years.

Summary: * MIRROR & COMMON CARP stocked in 2006 to 45lb * WEL`S CATFISH to 70lb * Stunning 12.5 acre lake 3h 40m from Calais * 10 Swims * Maximum 8 Anglers * Cabin with decking & benches * Cooking facilities (including oven, hobs & gas BBQ) * English Showers and Toilets * Electric Points for bait boats and phones etc. * Maximum 3 rods per Angler * No Poisson chat * Carp Mats & Weigh Slings Provided For Each Angler Description: Etang de Chanet is situated in the heart of the Champagne Ardennes Region - Close to Troyes. A 3 Hour 40 Minute drive from Calais. The owners are Kev and Jo Saggers who are a very friendly english couple and will help you in every way they can to make you feel at home and enjoy your trip. Etang de Chanet is a stunning and peaceful, 12.5 acre lake set in dense woodland. In 2006 the lake was drained and netted and then stocked with 2 tonne of virgin fish as well as the original stock from the lake. Nearly all of the new and already present fish were Mirror and Common carp ranging from 12lb to just over 45lb. Taking into account the average yearly growth rate some specimens could be tipping the scales at 60lb. Considering quite a few of these are still uncaught and untarnished virginal fish this should make for a very exciting and active season.

Also present in the lake are some pike which were re-stocked from the original netting. As to how big they are we are not sure but some nice specimens have been caught on pike fishing sessions at the lake. Etang De Chanet is also home to some beautiful wildlife including Jays, Buzzards and Kingfisher to name but a few. Lake: The Lake has 10 swims which have been carefully situated around the lake to provide a feature to fish to for each angler. For example islands, overhanging trees, margins lilies and also open water. The depths vary from 2 ft. – 8 ft. with a silt bottom. We welcome a maximum of 8 anglers per week, which will ensure a more intimate fishing experience for you and also provide the option of moving swims if desired. There are no poisson-chats present in the lake (a nuisance species of catfish which are present in some French fisheries. We all know there is nothing more frustrating than fishing all night with no bait on your hook.)

Stock: The rest of the stock consisted of a handful of wels catfish which at present time are estimated to be at around 40-50lb. Our newest edition to the lake is `Mandy`, a sexy specimen 70lb mandarine wels catfish whom we couldn’t resist buying down to her sheer beauty.

There is a cabin on site with full cooking facilities including oven, hobs & a big gas BBQ, freezer for bait (limited size) and electric points for charging phones, ipod docks and bait boats etc. There are also 2 english toilets and 2 powerful showers. We provide Carp Mats & Weigh Slings for every angler.

France does not get any more picturesque than this, and has an abundance of wildlife which includes, wild boar, deer, lizards, herons, kingfishers, woodpeckers; in fact the list is endless with hatfuls of birds of prey, owls and miles and miles of farm land. The nearest city is 30 miles away so you don't even have light pollution, sit at night and look up at the stars, fantastic! The bank side is mowed regularly, beautiful little flowers planted, trees kept plush and as we find a snag in the lake it is removed. Some of the swims are natural, grass that goes down to the water’s edge, some are cut out and edged off with railway sleepers. Because we are down in the valley there is normally a breeze coming from somewhere, and if not there are enough trees to shelter under when things warm up. There is a locked gate and the lake is fenced off, you can park your car behind every swim, so no mile hike with your tackle! the only vehicles we get here are the tractors out in the fields. With no factories, smells or noises. Peace and tranquillity is permanently at hand.

Lake: We are now into our first year, we have had some wonderful fish out. Lake depths vary from a general 10ft all over with cuts that go to 13ft, shelves that come up to 7 ft, the end by the shower and toilet have just received a good planting of lilies, the corner stays around 3-5 foot until you get to forty feet out where it drops down to 13 ft then comes up on a bar, the other side goes to 10 ft. Plumbing with a rod is worthwhile, you do need to think a little about your fishing here, it's not a supermarket type lake. Roger, the previous owner of Lyngors has fished Janine, formerly Etang de Vouvray for 8 years, he told me "the first year I arrived I watch a common of around 40lb in the margins, this fish has had me return every year." At first, maize scored well but now boilies have come into their own, and looking at the fish's diets there is a change in the baiting policy for 2005. (see bait for details) There are four stone picnic tables that resemble a setting at Stonehenge! They are along the side of the lake and have been well received. There is no need to move from the water’s edge as we deliver breakfast and a home cooked meal, many a night we bring over some meat, salad and have a bbq, We supply you with clean water, bin bags, take all you rubbish away, There are clean hot water showers, toilets bankside, we charge you batteries/phone, boat, lights, we have freezer space for your frozen baits, but as we roll our own and they go into the lake regularly, we suggest you use these on a couple of rods. At present we have 3 boats available around the lake and have not had any problems with them, I will monitor the situation with them yearly, and then decide for 2006. Bait: NO NEED TO FILL YOU CAR WITH STINKY BAITS THAT WEIGH A TON AND TAKE UP ALL YOUR ROOM! Our home rolled baits are a quality food source for Carp, below is a list of ingredients used in their manufacture, showing how much thought, time, effort and expense we have taken to achieve the end product, we hand roll, hand boil and hand pack them. The Facilities: We have two large chest freezers so we can store your favourite baits, tell us what you need and we will bring it over with your next delivery of food. Daily we supply fresh water in clean containers for your tea - coffee etc. We recharge your batteries for you bait boats, torches, telephones and walkie talkies.

Etang des Royales - is a 25 acre French carp fishing holiday complex nestled amongst a forest setting in France and comprises of two well stocked fishing lakes one containing carp and the other catfish.

The main carp fishing lake is 15 acres, has a gravel bottom with plenty of features and an average depth of about 6-7ft with the deepest part reaching 9ft. There are also deep margins allowing the fish to be landed with ease. The bank of the lake is also gravel, lined with mature trees and bushes.

Website : http://www.etangdeuxpierres.co.uk/

Description: Has a stunning 14 acre lake with an island There are 10 swims some of which could easily be doubles for a maximum of 8 anglers. This gives anglers plenty of room with some swims having the option of fishing the island and others having plenty of open water with various features to each swim from the obvious margins to overhanging trees, the island, various bars and troughs, gravel, sand and silt pockets. Lake & Stock: The lake was originally stocked with 170 carp in 2002. These fish were not fished for until September 2006 when I went there to do some test fishing. The fishing was obviously prolific with 50 fish averaging 21 pound caught in a short session of only fishing days. However, since then we have been piling the bait in including 1 ton of high protein carp pellet and the fish are growing very quickly with many of the original stock now being 28-30 pounds (January 2007). We have also added a further 60 carp, the majority of which were 30+ including several 40’s up to a brace weighing 46-8 each (common and mirror). These are all farm bred fish and are expected to put weight on quickly once on the pellet and bait. There are no poisson chats or bream to our knowledge, however we have caught several roach and rudd over 3 pound on small baits. One catfish has been stocked at 72 pound and there are apparently 6 huge grass carp that have yet to show themselves. Facilities: There are English style toilets and shower facilities at one end of the lake with additional toilets for the swims that are away from the main toilet and shower block. There is also facilities for charging of batteries for bait boats, phones etc. ETANG des "DEUX PIERRES" has added to one of the swims, known as "The Beach", a wooden cabin which can easily accommodate two bed chairs plus extras for that little bit of comfort and ease.

Website: http://boysaway-carping.com/etang-du-bois/

Description: During 2005, the lake was drained to allow desilting of the lake and adding extra depth. We took the opportunity of adding some additional features to the lake bottom. These consisted of introducing a new main channel that runs the entire length of the lake accompanied by smaller channels running from the margins to the main channel.

As the runs water of the complex it tends to have a greater number of the smaller fish however the lake record at present is a 42 mirror. There are also plenty of twenties and thirties to keep you occupied along with grass Carp to the mid forties and Catfish up to eighty pounds

Lake: At just over six acres in size, Etang Du Bois is the smallest lake on the complex. We class this lake as the runs water of the complex and it has been stocked to ensure that there’s always plenty of action day and night. There are seven purpose built swims and these have been positioned in between the reed beds or trees that line the margins. The swims are large enough to accommodate a two man bivvy and provide room for you to move around.

They have also been positioned so that they allow each angler his own clearly defined water. All swims allow you to fish from your own margin to the far margin without the worries of casting into someone else’s swim and also ensure that you can intercept the patrolling carp.32:T7bf,Location: Set in the tranquil Marne Valley with the River Marne as the southernmost border.

Description: The use of boats is allowed on the lake as long as life jackets are worn and that the boat is used in a safe and responsible manner. Boats supplied with oars and lifejackets are available for hire. There plentiful supply of electric engines available for the boats which comes with two fully charged leisure batteries. The use of bait boats is also allowed.

Fishing is not allowed from the North bank which means that you will not have anyone fishing from the opposite bank. The swims have for the year (2007) have undergone extensive work, making them spacious, safe and clean as too have the paths and roads. Major investment has been put into the whole site to enhance the pleasure of fishing Chef de Ville

Lake: This 27 acre lake is the first in a series of six. The Lake is up to 160 yards wide and over 900 yards long. Depths vary from 3 feet to 20 feet with the majority of the lake bed being clay or gravel. There are a number of weed beds mainly around the bars and margins. Fishing tight to these weed beds produces good catches

Stock: Following the restocking in 2003'4 we successfully introduced a further 1 ton of Carp up to 62 lbs. have in 2007. This pushes the the current stock levels to over 400 carp, half of which are in excess of 30lbs. A further Half ton of carp has been added in 2008 with a70lb Catfish.

Facilities: Chef de Ville has recently purchased the house next to the entrance gate to the fishery. The property has a large basement which has been converted into a large dining area. There is also a new shower room with two showers, two toilets and hand basin.

A large breakfast and evening meal will be served in the dining area or it can be brought to your swim by request.

Recharging facilities are available for Mobile Phones - Bait boat batteries etc.

Limited Freezer storage facilities for bait.33:T5ff,Description: If your idea of a great French Carp Fishing Holiday venue is a reed fringed, historic estate lake set amongst mature forest with beautiful features like lily pads, overhanging trees and reed beds, then look no further.

The larger lake is recorded as being in existence in 1833 but was originally created by the local monk’s centuries ago to breed carp for the table as were many of the best lakes in France. The carp are virgin fish as the lake has never been fished on a commercial basis by the previous French owners.

The natural surrounding give bags of features to fish to, from extensive lily beds to marginal rushes and fallen and overhanging trees, something for everyone regardless of style. Trois Fontaine combines all of these features with awesome fishing for carp to over 40lb, sensible rules and space and tranquillity that is hard to find on any venue.

Lakes: The two lakes at Trois Fontaine consist of a 21 acre mature estate lake and a two acre more recently built lake (still over 30 years old) that gives a variety of fishing, from feature rich margin to wide open vistas.

Stock: Mirror Carp of over 30lb are a common occurrence at Trois Fontaine, with a good chance of a 40lb+ specimen always on the cards, and the stock are piling on the weight year on year. We have carried out an extensive stocking program to complement the existing stock and we know that we have several 40's to crown the existing and introduced stock of 20's and 30's, one fish in particular is expected to top 50 this year.34:T410,Bleu also contains plenty of catfish, with the average weight (excluding offspring) being 54lbs and the largest just touching 95lbs. The good news is that these are banked nearly every week, and sometimes in massive numbers as there are virtually no snags to worry about anywhere in the lake.

This lake is renowned for the quality and quantity of fish that can be landed, with weekly catches of over 1000lbs not uncommon. Feature laden, the 5 anglers it can accommodate can choose from gravel bars, an island, overhanging trees and beautiful lily patches to fish to. Bleu is a favourite with many of our customers who come back year after year for the sheer beauty of the surroundings, not to mention the personal best beating fish!

Again, you have the sole use of a bankside summer chalet, containing a gas supply, cooker, pots, pans, sink and patio table/chairs.A toilet is also present within 50 metres and a boat is available on request. We allow a maximum of six people on this holiday with a maximum of five fishing at any one time.35:T5ea,Location: Champagne

On the contrary, our client’s book one year in advance and in October the lake is for 80% fully booked. Just have a look at the availability.

Each peg has a little boat that can be used for two hours morning and evening for the purpose of ground baiting. You can also use your remote control bait boat if you respect these baiting hours. The boats shouldn’t be used for placing of hook baits. The whole site is completely closed so this will give you a safe feeling.

Description: Lac Du Charlou was purchased at the beginning of 2005 knowing that it had bag loads of potential to become a truly stunning location to bivvy up at and catch some very big carp. So, that is what we set out to do, and have now achieved our goal after a lot of hard graft, travelling, and also parting with a lot of hard earned money. The lake was named Lac Du Charlou after our two daughters, Charlotte and Louise, lucky beggars! Having been carp fishing to France enough times to know what, for me, makes a great week for a carper I wanted to put it in to practice by supplying this at a sensible cost, and enjoying it along the way by making it a week to remember for every visitor.

Lake: This stunning sixteen acre gravel pit has clear blue water, excellent for your photos, and is tree lined around the entire lake set within 24 acres of beautiful French woodland and countryside. There are some lovely views across the lake to lay and gaze at from your bivvy as the sun goes down in between catching your prize carp. Most anglers who have fished here also take home some lovely shots of the lake and its borders to remind themselves and show others just how nice it really is. The venue is nestled amongst some of the world’s most famous big carp waters on the border of the Orient Forest, home to Lac Orient and Lac Ammance, and I can guarantee you will be well impressed with the tranquillity of this one. The pegs, both double and single, are well spaced out for a maximum of ten anglers who will have ample room to fish with three or even four rods in certain pegs. There is plenty of space to bivvy up, with every peg being level and gravelled for drainage and comfort. Unhooking mats are supplied in each peg to lighten your load and care for our fish which are all in tip top condition.

Stock: The depths of the lake vary from 2 feet to 26 feet and the lake bed in mainly hard gravel with features to find and fish to. At present the lake holds over 350 carp, including mirrors, commons and leathers, ranging from 15lb to over 56b and growing fast! The nearest main town for everything you could possibly want is only a 5 minute drive away and includes a tackle and gaming shop which believe it or not sells carping gear. For those who do like to get away from fishing for a while can relax in the town at one of the lovely bars next to the waterfall in the town centre. Personally I would prefer to be fishing but at times it can get very hot in the Champagne region, and do not forget that you are also on holiday lads, and we will try our utmost to make it one to remember for you.37:T499,Etang de la Horre Location: Champagne region Website: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=4 Description: Just imagine. A lake of 110 hectare, surrounded by a spectacular National Park of 250 hectare, stocked with 3000 big carps from 10 until 60 pounds, and all this for you… yes, this is THE ultimate carp fishing venue where every serious carp hunter must have fished at least once in his lifetime. We rate La Horre as a moderate, to difficult water. There's a feeder stream running down the length of the lake bed so it has the classic features of gentle slopes to the centre with shallow water at the top end. Maximum depth of La Horre is 2.5 m. Two bivvies can be placed on each pontoon (6 m x 4.5 m). Use screws or cup hooks to fix the bivvies, nails are not allowed. When it rains it can be quite muddy around the peg. The pegs 4 to 9 lie at a considerable distance from the parking place, you will need a little barrow to carry your tackle. The bathrooms and the showers can be used 24 h a day.

The lake is completely private, peaceful and secure and teems with birds and wildlife.","tags":["Region","Lower-Normandy","French Departments","50 Manche"],"url":"https://www.carpview.com/french-carp-lakes/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=336","listingPage":"https://www.carpview.com/french-carp-lakes/519","scrapedAt":"2025-11-09T06:40:51.316Z","region":"Lower-Normandy","departments":["50 Manche"],"lakeSizes":[],"travelFromCalais":[],"travelFromStMalo":[],"scrapedDate":"$D2025-11-09T06:40:51.316Z","slug":"careys-carp-lake-15"},{"name":"Carp and Cats","website":null,"websiteUrl":null,"email":null,"contact":null,"fishStocked":null,"description":"$d","tags":["Region","Limousin","French Departments","24 Dordogne","Lake Size","1 to 3 arces","Travel Time from Calais","Over 5hrs"],"url":"https://www.carpview.com/french-carp-lakes/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=142","listingPage":"https://www.carpview.com/french-carp-lakes/519","scrapedAt":"2025-11-09T06:40:56.727Z","region":"Limousin","departments":["24 Dordogne"],"lakeSizes":["1 to 3 arces"],"travelFromCalais":["Over 5hrs"],"travelFromStMalo":[],"scrapedDate":"$D2025-11-09T06:40:56.727Z","slug":"carp-and-cats-16"},{"name":"Carp Creuse Angling","website":null,"websiteUrl":null,"email":null,"contact":null,"fishStocked":null,"description":"$e","tags":["Region","Limousin","French Departments","23 Creuse","Lake Size","3 to 5 arces","Travel Time from Calais","Over 5hrs"],"url":"https://www.carpview.com/french-carp-lakes/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=151","listingPage":"https://www.carpview.com/french-carp-lakes/519","scrapedAt":"2025-11-09T06:41:02.170Z","region":"Limousin","departments":["23 Creuse"],"lakeSizes":["3 to 5 arces"],"travelFromCalais":["Over 5hrs"],"travelFromStMalo":[],"scrapedDate":"$D2025-11-09T06:41:02.170Z","slug":"carp-creuse-angling-17"},{"name":"Carp France Fishery","website":"www.carpfrance.com","websiteUrl":"http://www.carpfrance.com/","email":"info@carpfrance.com","contact":null,"fishStocked":"Carp","description":"Carp France Fishery","tags":["Region","Poitou-Charentes","French Departments","16 Charente","Lake Size","3 to 5 arces","Travel Time from Calais","Over 5hrs","Travel Time from St Malo","Over 5hrs"],"url":"https://www.carpview.com/french-carp-lakes/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=454","listingPage":"https://www.carpview.com/french-carp-lakes/519","scrapedAt":"2025-11-09T06:41:13.065Z","region":"Poitou-Charentes","departments":["16 Charente"],"lakeSizes":["3 to 5 arces"],"travelFromCalais":["Over 5hrs"],"travelFromStMalo":["Over 5hrs"],"scrapedDate":"$D2025-11-09T06:41:13.065Z","slug":"carp-france-fishery-18"},{"name":"Carp Haven","website":"http://www.cjfrenchretreat.com/","websiteUrl":"http://www.cjfrenchretreat.com/","email":null,"contact":null,"fishStocked":"Carp, Pike, Tench, Roach","description":"Description: Carp Haven formally named Raynbow End lake is a natural, tranquil 3 acre lake nestling in 6 acres of private, beautiful woodland.
