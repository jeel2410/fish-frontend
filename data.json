    "description": "Etang de la Horre Location: Champagne region Website: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=4 Description: Just imagine. A lake of 110 hectare, surrounded by a spectacular National Park of 250 hectare, stocked with 3000 big carps from 10 until 60 pounds, and all this for you… yes, this is THE ultimate carp fishing venue where every serious carp hunter must have fished at least once in his lifetime. We rate La Horre as a moderate, to difficult water. There's a feeder stream running down the length of the lake bed so it has the classic features of gentle slopes to the centre with shallow water at the top end. Maximum depth of La Horre is 2.5 m. Two bivvies can be placed on each pontoon (6 m x 4.5 m). Use screws or cup hooks to fix the bivvies, nails are not allowed. When it rains it can be quite muddy around the peg. The pegs 4 to 9 lie at a considerable distance from the parking place, you will need a little barrow to carry your tackle. The bathrooms and the showers can be used 24 h a day. Booking through: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=4 Fishing on this lake is subject to local regulations, please ask for details",

    "description": "Lac de Moisson\n\nLocation: Situated northwest of Paris (Department Yvelines)\n\nDescription: Lac de Moisson is a securely fenced venue with a 120 hectares lake. It’s a real specimen lake where several carp have surpassed the 30kg barrier. We wouldn’t recommend Lac the Moisson for beginners because it’s not an easy lake. People that have fished bigger lakes like Lac du Der, Orient or Cassien however, will enjoy fishing this lake.\n\nLake: With its 120 hectares, Lac the Moisson is, with La Horre, one of the bigger lakes in our offer. The venue is fringed by the River Seine, from which it formerly made part of. The lake is quite deep; maximum depth is 6 m. In fact, the level of the lake depends on the level of the River Seine. When the water level is high, there is normally no weed formation. On the contrary, when the level is low, there might be some weed formation. This occurs towards the hotter summer months. The bottom is very irregular and is mostly hard with stones and sand. The depth maps we’ve made of the lake, show lots of hidden spots and a very interesting plateau in front of swims 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 about 200m from the bank. The booking agent recommends taking enough line on your spool to be able to fish these spots. Order a depth map of your swim HERE.\n\nThe management of the site has integrated the different activities well with carp fishing. The sailing activities are restricted to the Eastern part of the lake.\n\nSwims: On the Southwest banks there are 11 well-spaced double swims, each at a distance of 100 m. All swims have vehicle access over a gravel path. Cars can be parked at the swim.\n\nStock: Originally, Lac de Moisson had a relatively small fish stock from the River Seine. These fish grew strongly due to the presence of plenty of natural food like mussels and crayfish. Now, the lake is very well stocked with both mirrors and commons, ranging in size from doubles to 30kg+ with a very good population of fish over the 30lb mark.\n\nThe bailiff advises tiger nuts, fish meal and blood boilies. If you don’t want to catch bream he suggests larger boilies and no ground baiting with pellets. While choosing your hook links, take into account the presence of freshwater mussels and the crayfish (use braid hook links).\n\nFacilities: There are toilets and showers for the anglers near swim 11.\n\nBooking through: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=9",

    "description": "Location: Limousin\n\nWebsite: http://www.anglinglines.com/Alder/\n\nDescription: Alder Lake is a mature lake dating back to the 1960s. It is set in the centre of 150 acres of Limousin farmland and trees. Check out the aerial view on Google Maps, and you’ll see there are no roads, railways or pylons close by. All our visitors comment about the beautiful and peaceful countryside. The lake is 10 acres in size and can be booked by up to 5 anglers giving a massive 2 acres of space per person (at least). The lake is set in the centre of France, but thanks to the great motorway network it is only 5½ hours from Caen\n\nLake: This beautiful lake is set in a natural bowl and fringed by mature oaks, chestnuts and alders. It is fed by two streams on either flank of the isthmus giving two sets of features, one on each side. The overhanging trees on the isthmus provide plenty of snags and cover and are great fish holding areas. The rest of the lake is snag free. It has a stony bottom with silt channels following the old stream beds. The pegs are cut between the trees giving plenty of cover. Depths range from shallows to 15ft, and there are no weed problems.\n\nFacilities: Because Alder is set in the middle of glorious unspoilt countryside it’s not possible to connect it up to mains electricity or water, so the facilities are basic and environmentally sensitive. The toilet system was purchased from Canada where the provision of hygiene services in the arctic wilderness is a problem long since solved! A low flush self cleaning toilet leads to a bio-digester which in the long term generates compost. The low flush volume is provided by a bucket of lake water and no fossil fuel is burnt to provide it!\n\nIn a separate cabin there is a gas cooker. Fresh water is fetched down from the owners farm house in containers. Lighting is currently provided by gas lamps (these will eventually be superseded by solar powered lights).\n\nThe main toilet, shower and freezer facilities are located at the owner’s farm which is about a 5 minute walk away.",

During the last few years, Mr. Dollat (Mayor of Perigny la Rose) with his team have refurnished this pit and made all the banks available for fishing. The lake is totally secured with a fence covering the full 15 acres of land. There is a track that goes all around the perimeter. The swims are well spaced out, with grassy areas for bivvies and rods. The banks are very smooth, which give you the opportunity to fish anywhere you like.\n\nThe lake bed, in true gravel pit style, is anything but flat with gravel bars, deep holes and plateaus all over the place. Bait boats are allowed on this venue and could be an advantage for precise baiting and presentation. There is not a lot of weed – a big head of grass carp do a good job at keeping it at bay.\n\nThe lake has a very big head of carp that was stocked bi-annually by the mayor of Périgny la Rose until 2008. One of the nice things about the venue is the high proportion of commons present – the lake record common stands at 55lb.\n\nThe average size is between 32lb – 35lb, with mirrors and over 55lb having been banked. There is a very healthy head of 30-35-pounds carp.\n\nIn January 2010, another ton of fish, commons, mirrors and linears to over 30lbs were added by us to boost the original stock",

The fishery is set in a thirty acre estate and covers twenty four acres of water.\n\nThe complex is set to a backdrop of woodland providing a quiet and relaxing atmosphere and is totally private and secure. The lakes cover various levels of carp angling offering all aspects from a runs water to harder lakes with larger fish for the more dedicated angler.\n\nThe site provides a relaxing holiday partly due to our policy of only having a limited number of anglers per week, allowing everyone the opportunity to move swims or lakes during their stay if they wish. Since we have owned the lakes there has been a continuous programme of works to improve the complex for both the anglers and our fish. This has consisted of desilting them, adding features and improving the stock levels of fish.\n\nThere is a fully equipped shower and toilet facilities located on the outside of the house and these are connected to all main services.\n\nThe complex is located in a small hamlet, about 5 minutes from the local town that provides all amenities including supermarkets, bars and banks. We trust this gives an insight into Paradis de la Peche and further details on each lake, facilities and the area can be found on this website.",

    "description": "Location: Dordogne: We are located approximately 45 minutes, by car from Limoges and 1 hour 15 minutes from Bergerac\n\nWebsite: http://www.carpandcats.com\n\nDescription:\n\nThe lake at Carp and Cats is a well established haven for fish. Formerly owned by a French family who used it as their holiday home. It seems though that no fishing ever took place. Rumour has it that the French only fish to eat and not for pleasure so they missed out on the joys of sitting on these sleepy banks with a rod in hand.\n\nThe lake is three acres in size, set in ten acres of beautiful tranquil and secluded woodland, all of which is securely fenced but with easy vehicle access. It is fed by several natural springs with varying depths to cater for all types of angling. Ideally suited to four anglers with a maximum of six permitted. There is a small island adorned by one of many beautiful overhanging silver birch trees making an ideal spot to fish to. You may prefer to stalk in the margins or fish our open water. All of this is possible here. The hard bottom of the lake combined with gravel bars allows perfect bait presentation. For the less mobile angler, the flat banks are ideal for easy access. With depths ranging from 18 inches to 14 feet with no snags the lake is perfect for any type of fishing. All of these features will add to the fun of fishing at the Carp and Cats location.\n\nStock:The lake is stocked with the highest quality carp – sourced from the most reputable fish farmer in France. There is a mixture of commons and mirrors, including plenty of hard fighting virgin carp up to 40lbs+. There is also a large head of catfish up to 61lbs+, with none less than late doubles. We have a large stock pond and two basins that enable us to keep the fish population at an optimum level for all of our anglers. This will ensure you don’t go short of a decent run or two.\n\nFacilities:Luxury Chalet\n\nNestling on the bank of the lake our luxury IRM chalet provides excellent accommodation for up to six people. It offers two double bedrooms (one with a double bed, the other with twin beds) and a double pull out sofa in the lounge area. It also has a bathroom and separate toilet and a well equipped kitchen. It is furnished to a high standard with almost every modern comfort you could wish for. In addition it benefits from an outside terrace with table and chairs where you can relax and enjoy the beautiful views over the lake.\n\nTepee with Fire Pit\n\nWhy not try camping with a twist and spend one of your nights in a traditional Indian Tepee. Sleeping underneath the stars and cooking on our completely open fire pit will be an unforgettable magical experience never to be forgotten.\n\nFacilities\n\nIf you enjoy table tennis or badminton, then we have the equipment for you to use. Or for the younger ones, the Adventure Playground is available as well. We have something for everyone - whether you want to work off the great food that's available in the Dordogne or just entertain the children, we've got it all here at Carp and Cats.\n\nBooking information:Click here for booking information",

    "description": "Location: In March 2008, Iktus opened its carp section, a carp fishing centre located in the Laroin commune, near Pau, Southern France (Béarn, Atlantic Pirenees, 64).\n\nDescription: The Lake is situated near the trout reservoir. It has a surface of 35 hectares its depth varies between 1 and 10 m. The water is clean, very clear and is of a very high quality. The venue is about 40 years old and is stretched out over 1 kilometer. Weed Possible during summer months\n\nStock: The carp stock varies between 6 and 25 kg and we expect some big surprises this year as carp can feed on a wide range of natural food. Fishing is only allowed from the banks, fixed swims, from March until November. There is neither crayfish nor catfish. In 2007 the owners restocked the lake with some extra, fast growing carp (4 to 8 kg). During the test session in October 2007 we were very surprised as we noticed that the same fish had almost doubled his weight in 6 months!\n\nSwims: There are a total of 13 double swims. In front of swim 6 you will find the deepest spots that are very interesting for sturgeon and big catfish. Swim 7 is very interesting because there lie a number of dead trees on the bottom of the lake; which doesn't make this swim an easy one. During the summer months there might be some weed in front of swims 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. The weed grows near the banks, but sometimes there's some weed formation on deeper spots in swims 4 and 9. It's highly recommended to rent a boat to row out the rigs and to be sure they lie correctly.\n\nFacilities / Services: Our anglers are welcome in the club house every day from 9.00h. We have a small tackle shop in the mezzanine; the bar/restaurant has a nice terrace with fantastic views over the lake. There are two showers at the lake.\n\nThere's a special carp angler cottage at the other side of the venue where you can prepare your food (micro wave over, fridge, congelator) and there is also a WC. There are little chalets for rent with 2 or 3 bedrooms - blankets are not available, you have to bring them. At Iktus you can hire a holiday home with 2 bedrooms, kitchen, living-room, terrace and balcony, plenty of space for the children to play, etc.\n\nThe bailiff Julien, a good carp angler, offers our clients all kinds of boilies (Fanatic baits), pellets, particles, etc. You can rent your tackle on the site, as well as boats (only the boats from Iktus are allowed, you can not bring your own boat). At Ikus they also offer a shuttle service from and to the local airport of Pau (operated by several low cost airlines, like Ryanair), situated at about 10 min from the lake.\n\nBooking thought: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=1",

Carp Quarry has been set up for the discerning anglers who want peace and tranquillity at a truly stunning venue with top quality carp fishing where you and your party have exclusive use of the 3 bedroom gite/cottage and the lake.\n\nLake: Carp Quarry is a very old deep granite quarry which closed in 1938 and now fills from underground springs. This 3 acre lake truly is one of the most unusual stunning fishing venues in France. To the far side of the lake rising from the water are 100 ft granite cliffs which are home to many birds of prey. The swims are along one side of the lake which have been excavated to make large comfortable swims where it is possible to cast over to the overhanging trees on the cliff face opposite. The lake which is set in its own grounds has a large lockable gated entrance. You can park your car within the lake complex giving you total privacy. No permits are required and fishing is permitted day and night. We recommend 4 persons fishing but can accommodate up to 6. The lake is very deep with mainly a rock and gravel bottom with a few silty areas.\n\nStock: We have just stocked in excess of a ton of fish supplied by a local fish farmer in the winter of 2008. The smallest of these fish being 23lb up to the mid 40's with the average fish being nearly 30lb. These are the quick growing large framed royal strain mainly mirrors with a few common, to complement the existing fish stocks. The lake was stocked with carp and trout by the previous owner in 1995 but was only fished for trout up until the year 2000, since then it has been left untouched. The lake dates back to 1938 when it stopped production as a quarry. It holds a good head of wild carp as well as the original mirrors and commons which we know very little about but have heard stories about monster commons. We have seen one of them that looked in excess of 50lb, so the lake may produce one or two surprises. There are also very nice trout, rudd and perch with the odd large pike. There are crayfish in the lake but these do not cause a problem to the fishing as the large carp eat them as soon as they appear.\n\nFacilities: The accommodation is a detached 3 bedroom house situated 150yrds up the road from the lake (just a 2 minute walk), you can park at the gite and also at the lakeside. All 3 bedrooms have twin beds, there is a well equipped kitchen/diner with washing machine dishwasher cooker microwave fridge freezer etc and a large separate lounge with large log burner, tv/dvd and a bait fridge freezer. There is also a large patio with table and chairs. The bathroom has a bath with shower over.",

    "description": "Description: Carp Heaven is a beautiful and very tranquil tree lined lake of almost 15 acres (6 hectares) located in the Burgundy region of France. It is surrounded by woods and pastures grazed by the local white charolais cows. The depth varies from just under 3ft at the shallow end and it gets deeper towards the dam wall where it has depths of up to 8ft with the average of about 5ft. The shallows covers an area of about 4 acres and is an area that the fish love to sunbathe and feed and has 8 islands and 3 swims. The main area of the lake has 11 swims, many of which are doubles. The bottom is a sandy/clay which is quite common with many French lakes and there is very little weed. The lake was emptied in November 2006 when virtually 100% of the snags were removed. The longest cast required is only about 90 - 100 yd's so rods of 2.75lb test with fully loaded bait runners and 2.5oz leads should get you anywhere on this lake and bait boats are permitted. At more than 1/4 mile long, new clients pull into the car park and are delighted to see the lake stretching out before them. There is a fantastic mixture of wildlife that visits the lake including Deer, Golden Orielles, Hoopies, Buzzards, Kingfishers, Storks, Egrets, Red Squirrels, Pine Martins etc,etc.\n\nStock: Carp",

Whilst other venues occasionally steal the limelight, Cassien is always at the hearts of serious carp anglers and just to walk the banks of this incredible venue is a privilege. Catching form there is a dream. We are the only company to offer holidays to this fantastic location which basks in the sunshine near to Nice in the south of France. The holiday season out here is between the middle of June and the middle of September and it's the ideal place to get a bit of sunshine and land a historic carp. We've got accommodation, transfers from the airport, tackle provided and also full advice on the best way to fish there so you literally just need to bring yourself, your clothes, some buzzers and reels, and your terminal tackle box. We've got the rest, and it's exactly the sort of kit that you need.\n\nIf you want to experience Cassien at its best then look no further. This is the place for you.\n\nYou fly into Nice airport with one of the cheapy airlines (Easyjet and BMI fly to Nice from the UK for less than a hundred quid) and we'll pick you up from the airport and take you to our base 10 minutes from the lake. From there we'll kit you out, point you in the right direction, and get you fishing. French rules only allow fishing from dawn until dusk but this is often the most productive time especially though the holiday season.\n\nWhat's Included?\n\nWhat do we need to bring:\n\nYou stay on a fantastic camp site a few minutes away from Cassien and we take you down to the lake and bring you back every day.\n\nIncluded in the price is tented accommodation but you can upgrade to either a mobile home or a chalet for a small charge should you so wish. A lot of guys like to bring their wives' or girlfriends with them and we would suggest an upgrade in this circumstance for extra privacy.\n\nThe Site has a fantastic pool and restaurant area where you can chill out if you don't want to fish all day, and there is always the opportunity of a trip out to the beach to either Nice or Cannes, or alternatively if you fancy a bit of action then you can visit the local water park.\n\nAll of our equipment is exactly what you need to fish Cassien so there is no need to bring anything with you other than reels, buzzers and your terminal tackle box. We suggest you buy a terminal pack, details of which you will get when you book, but other that we have got everything that you need.",

    "description": "Description: Cedar is a mature gravel pit of around 4 acres in size which has 2 lakeside wooden chalets, both with their own fishing platforms. 4 anglers can hire the whole lake exclusively, including both chalets, but we also accept bookings from 2 pairs of anglers – each pair having use of one of the chalets.\n\nLake: 4 acres in size and has 4 swims. Cedar is set in its own very private grounds, securely fenced in and separated from the road by the large Cedar trees from which it takes its name. The owners, Tommy and George Young, know what’s needed to produce a first class fishery, both in terms of carp stock and facilities, and they will spare no expense to do it... so you can be confident that Cedar is a top quality venue\n\nFacilities: They have installed two new wooden chalets on opposite banks of the lake, each having steps down to its own large, comfortable fishing platform. Each chalet has electricity, a fridge and cooking facilities and will comfortably sleep 2 people in 2 single beds (no bedding is supplied at all – please bring your own pillows, sleeping bags etc). At present there is no mains water available in the chalets but there is a refillable water tank to provide water for washing up etc. The newly built toilet and shower block does have mains water and drainage and is housed in a separate cabin on the third bank, a couple of minutes walk from either chalet. Access by car is possible to both chalets.\n\nBecause of the steps down to the fishing platforms from the chalets it would be too dangerous to allow fishing from the chalet i.e. you must be down on the platform with your rods if they are fishing. There’s plenty of room to bivvy up on the platforms so night fishing is not a problem.",

We have a total of 12 acres consisting of an ancient five and half acre lake surrounded by large lawns and a private woodland.\n\nIt is therefore a well established lake and for that reason we have tried our best not to change or disturb it. All the banks surrounding the lake are low and are therefore easy accessible for both catching and returning.\n\nFacilities: Just behind the chalet there are laundry facilities and an extra freezer / fridge should you require this.\n\nOn the land we have built a children’s play area with a large wooden frame housing a tree cabin with a slide and swings . There is a wooden wendy house which has footballs , frisbees , bats , balls , skipping ropes and many more to amuse the the children or even some adults ! There is an 18FT diameter above ground swimming pool with steps to climb in surrounded by a decking area . There is a covered Table Tennis table and also a Badminton net , with all the rackets , bats and balls provided .\n\nAll of this is situated in front of the chalet so you can relax while the children play for hours.\n\nBy the home there is a bbq area with tables and chairs for those long summer days and nights or take a walk in the woods and through the paths we have cut away and watch the wildlife or just listen to the birds.",

    "description": "Location: Situated a few kilometers from Reims in Northern France\n\nDescription: Coelacanthe, also known as “The Village”. This lake beats everybody’s expectations in terms of lake quality, fish stocking, facilities and service. Every detail is looked after and the owners have managed to create a five star carp fishing venue. If you’re looking for a luxury Carp fishing holiday – for the same price as other lakes – choose Coelacanthe! The Lake: This former gravel pit has a surface of 17 hectares. The bottom is fairly flat with no holes and the maximum depth is about 2,40 m. The margins drop off very quickly. There’s no weed formation during the hotter months, and there’s no Poisson chat at all. The bottom is mainly gravel with a little silt. The property has a secure perimeter and the entrance door is closed at night, which will give you a safe feeling. Notice the presence of mussels and crayfish. On the far end of the venue you can find the restaurant that has a fantastic view over the lake. The owner’s house is situated next to it. The Swims: The Lake is equally dotted with 7 single swims and 7 double swims. The singles are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12. The doubles are 1, 3, 10, 13, 14, 15 and 16. If you book two single swims for two anglers, you can still sit together in one of them and the other swim won’t be rented. All swims have good car access and you can park your car behind the swim. Just swims 14, 15 and 16 have no car access. The spacious swims are surrounded by lots of vegetation, which can provide you with enough shade in the summer. Boats are not allowed, but bait boats are. Placing of hook links is allowed but with restrictions. During the briefing, every angler will know exactly where he or she can fish up to, this is done to avoid crossing lines and to prevent jealous anglers from fishing on your hot spots. Every lake has its mythical swims where one catches presumably more fish, but the owner informed us that the fish are all over the lake. Ask Mr. Noll, the owner, about the hot spot of your swim… The Fish Stocks: Everybody knows that building a healthy carp stocking is difficult and takes a lot to time. It took 10 years to build the amazing Coelacanthe carp population of which 50% of the fish weigh over 15kg. You’ll catch mirrors, leathers, fully scales and commons. Every week a 20kg+ is landed and the lake record is 28,600 kg (2006). The 2009 lake record was a 26kg carp. The most exciting story of the 2009 season was an angler that caught 3 carp over 20 kg in less than 45 minutes! Besides carp you can also catch bass, sander, pike and catfish (over 100kg!). The Facilities: The facilities of Coelacanthe have a hygiene level of a five star hotel. Even your mother wouldn’t mind taking a shower. They charge 2 euros every time you have a shower, but it’s worth it!\n\nBooking Through: www.fishermanholidays.com/en/",

    "description": "Location: Situated in the Mayenne region, near Laval, in the lush agricultural countryside of rural north western France, it is about 2.5 hours from the ferry port of Caen\n\nWebsite: http://www.bigotlakes.co.uk/commons\n\nDescription: He’s replicated Morganes as closely as possible – a lake you book exclusively for up to 6 anglers, complete with mobile home accommodation and stuffed full of large, pristine carp. Morganes is virtually booked out 12 months in advance so we had no reason to suspect that Commons would not be the same... and so it’s proved.\n\nLake: Around 3 acres in size the lake is roughly square in shape. Overall depth is fairly shallow with an average of 1.5m to the left, shallowing up to around 1m on the right hand side. The lake bed while silty is fairly firm and clear. There are no snags or weed beds, but the far and right hand margins have over hanging trees that act as good holding areas for the carp. Access is possible to the mobile home by car and on foot all around the venue. The right hand side is flanked by fields and fishing is not possible from this bank.\n\nStock: Like its sister lakes, Morganes & Margot, Commons Lake is owned by one of France’s largest fish farmers, Michel Bigot, so the fish stocks are excellent. As its names suggests, the stock consist of 80% common carp and these include several 40lb+ specimens – a relative rarity in most lakes. The majority of the carp are twenties and thirties and there are a number of 40lb+ mirrors too. Catches of 60+ fish in the week are common... and 100+ not unknown!\n\nOther species include around 15 catfish to nearly 60lb, several of which are the rare Mandarin variety. There’s also a large diamond backed sturgeon of around 55lb. In total the stock numbers over 120 fish, ensuring excellent action as well as the possibility of banking a few superb specimens.\n\nFacilities: When you book this lake you get full use of the mobile home which sits right at the water’s edge. It has a fully fitted kitchen (with fridge freezer, cooker and oven), shower and toilet with hot water. There’s one double bedroom and one bedroom suitable for children with two bunk style beds. The living room sofas also double as single beds for two people. The living area has both UK and French wall sockets installed. This is basic accommodation – if you take partners and they’re looking for a bit of luxury they would be disappointed – but as a shelter and cooking station for anglers it’s perfect!\n\nOutside the mobile home is decking and a shelter with garden furniture that provides a perfect social areas while fishing the near bank.",

Carp fishing at the venue commenced in November 2008 and early indications suggest there are many big carp already present with fish to 50+ already landed. These carp have been left to thrive in there natural environment without fishing pressure for two decades! In the winter of 2008/2009.\n\nStock: we added a further 850 carp to forty pound, all uncaught mirrors from one of the best sources in France. We believe that added to the original stock Cretelakes will be among the very best carp fishing lakes France has to offer. In March 2010 we will be running organized all inclusive coach trips to and from Cretelakes with food packages included.\n\nLakes: Cretelakes is a beautiful 4 lake venue set in 60 acres.

It’s a large, varied venue with lots of islands, bays, lily pads and overhanging trees that provide plenty of challenges. The swims can be booked for weekends, weeks or midweeks.\n\nThe Lake\n\nDomaine de la Vallée has a total surface of 50 hectares (123 acres). Old trees and extensive fields surround the lake. Main features are islands, bays, overhanging trees and lily pads that provide plenty of challenges. In the northern part of the lake, a stream flows into the lake and provides plenty of oxygen, and natural food. This explains also why this part of the lake is colder and has clearer water. The fish, however, prefer the southern part with warmer water and more plankton. The bottom is irregular and has a soft layer of silk. Apart from the lilies, there are no obstacles. The depth varies between 0,50 m and 4 m.\n\nThe swims 1 to 12 lie in the southern part of the lake. Swims 7 to 11 are closed by the end of August due to the duck hunt that is organized there. This is not dangerous, but can be annoying. Swim 3 is located on a small island and provides interesting fishing possibilities. Swims 4 and 5 are very popular and a good choice for groups of 3 or 4 anglers. Swims 1 and 2 are spacious and deeper water; the car can be parked close to these swims. Swims 7+9 are interesting for a group of 3 anglers, whereas peg 8 is a good double swim. The swims on the island only have access by boat. You can bring your own boat or rent a boat on the site (8 euros per day). Bait boats are also allowed and so is placing off hook links and ground feeding with a boat.\n\nDomaine de la Vallée has an unknown, old stock of carp up to 50 pounds. The owners restocked the lake several times with younger animals. There’s plenty of natural food (crayfish, mussels, etc) and the carp are growing steadily. The bigger carp are not so easy to catch, but every good angler will catch some stunning carp.\n\nThe venue has a decent sanitary block with showers, washbasins and toilets. There are also 2 fridges, a freezer and a microwave oven for the anglers\n\nBooking through : http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=10",

The 60 acres of water on this private estate plays host to about 1,000 specimen carp up to 66lbs, with almost one hundred in the 40 to 60lb bracket. The complex, which is located within the most gorgeous settings, consists of three lakes which originally where all connected to each other by channels where the carp could move from lake to lake, however to enhance the quality of the fishing the channels have been blocked off so that we can offer different styles of fishing.\n\nThe Main LAKE: The main lake is limited to 12 anglers and offers the very realistic chance of some huge fish. There is one main Lodge at the North east end of the lake which when booked includes the 4 swims at that corner of the lake. There are also 2 cabins situated next to each other where it is possible to fish from the cabins. The lake record of 66 pounds is to be found in this lake along with a lot of the other big fish. As an added bonus 152 catfish where stocked into this lake in Jan 2000 ranging from 3 pounds to 30 pounds, and as expected these have piled on the weight pretty rapidly due to the amount of small fish in the lake and are now between 20 and 60 pounds. There are now 6 new benches situated around the main lake with power socket, lights and fridge. There are also lights and power situated in the swims. The lake bottom is clear firm peat and there is no weed to hinder you. Most baits work on this lake but the carp company baits sold on site really go well.\n\nThe Back Lake and new lodge: We now have a brand new luxury lodge which offers superb facilities for maximum comfort whilst fishing, including satellite TV, fridge freezer, cooking hob, microwave, large shower, toilet, 3 bedrooms, plates, cutlery, cooking utensils. Why not book the lodge and back lake exclusively and fish your own private estate lake. The back lake is about 7 acres and is limited to 6 anglers, as well as the originals this lake has been stocked with 400 carp to offer some easier fishing. The fish range from doubles to 40 pounds with the odd bigger fish which go up to a verified 52 pound common carp.",

    "description": "(Etang de la Barriere, Etang de la Fontaine) Location: Champagne region Website: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=5\n\nDescription: Domaine de Brocard is one of our most successful venues in France. No wonder the best pegs are already booked one year in advance. This former hunting domain, with a surface of 300 hectares, consists of 3 lakes surrounded by woodlands. The Lakes: On the first 12 hectare lake (550 m long, 100 wide) a maximum of 8 anglers can enjoy fishing from 4 pegs. They are situated on the south bank where anglers can fish without any possibility of snagging others lines. The gravel path provides good access to the pegs. The lake features over-hanging trees and reed-lined margins and on peg 1 there are some lily pads on the left side. Peg 1 is the only one-angler-peg of the venue. This first lake is stocked with 360 carp between 10 - 55 pounds. Maximum depth is 2 m. In the 2 hectare nurse-pond, fishing is not allowed. The third lake has a surface of 16 hectares and has a good access via a gravel path. Pegs 9 and 10 however can have a more difficult access by car when it rains. The tents stand on wooden pontoons. This lake is not deep, on average there's 1.5 m water and the bottom is soft without obstacles. Between pegs 6 and 7 lies a little island. Swim 12 is new for the 2007 season. Just like the first lake, there are over-hanging trees, reed-lined margins and lily pads in several areas. There are neither freshwater mussels nor crayfish. Take into account that there might be some weed formation when the water gets warmer (end of may, june...). This lake is stocked with 500 carp between 10 and 50 pounds. On the site there's a wooden toilet and in the village at 8 km there are facilities that consist of showers and toilets. Book through: Fishmans Holidays website",

    "description": "DreamLake 1 offers 'specimen style' fishing and regularly produces multiple catches of big-carp up to the mid fifty-pound range. The current records for the lake stand at an impressive 62lb 8oz mirror carp, 70lb 2oz common carp and a 130lb catfish.\n\nA 'square horseshoe' in shape and approx. 15-acres in size, we allow only 15 anglers per week on DreamLake 1 and with 23 well appointed swims to choose from, there is always plenty of space to move around. All of the swims are large, log lined gravelled areas - built by carp anglers for carp anglers. So large bivvies or tents are accommodated comfortably. Steps are thoughtfully placed for ease of access with 12 swims are designated as suitable for disabled/wheelchair angling.\n\nThe depth of DreamLake 1 varies between 6-9ft with many features to be found including gravel bars and weedbeds, plus the central spit of land that creates the horshoe shape providing a far-margin feature and bite hotspot. The lake is free from crayfish or poisson chat so common to other French waters - so you do not need to worry about netting hookbaits. The unique shape and layout of DreamLake 1 and positioning of the swims ensures that there is nowhere that you cannot cast too and nowhere for the fish to hide or hold-up out of reach.\n\nWith a record haul of 70 carp in one week, 220 carp (weighing in at over two tonnes) were added to the already impressive stock levels during December 2001 - with a further one tonne of new carp introduced in October 2003. A hundred thirty and forty pound carp were then introduced in November 2005 followed by 150 beautifully coloured chestnut mirror carp stocked in Nov 2007. Meaning both big-hit hauls of fish, as well as PB breaking big-carp captures are always on the cards - a uniquely mouthwatering carp fishing situation!\n\nDreamLake 2 offers anglers excellent 'specimen style' fishing providing every chance of hooking into a number of huge carp - with a massive head of twenty and thirty-pound carp backing-up the huge number of forty and fifty-pound fish topped by 60lb specimens!.\n\nThe current lake records are 61lb 8oz for common carp, 57lb 12oz for mirror carp, the catfish record stands at 97lb, and 44lb 8oz is the impressive grass carp record - with an arm-aching haul of 93 fish the most recorded by a single angler in one week.\n\nRectangular in shape and approx. 18-acres in size, we allow only 18 anglers per week on DreamLake 2. The 30 swims are all linked by a gravel track around the lake and with so many pegs to choose from there is always plenty of room to move if you wish. These easily accessible swims are well presented neat, log-lined gravelled areas. Large bivvies or tents are accommodated with ease and a number of swims close to the lodge are designated as suitable for disabled/wheelchair access.\n\nThe depth of DreamLake 2 varies between 5-7ft with many underwater features including gravel bars and silt pockets. Again there is no need to worry about protecting hookbaits with mesh, as there are no crayfish or poisson chat that often inhabit other French waters.\n\nThe stocking program of DreamLake 2 has seen the impressive head of specimen carp increased many fold over the years. Prior to opening in 1998, DreamLake 2 saw the addition of over five tonnes of carp including twenty forty-pound plus fish to 49lb, over twenty at 38lbs+, over 100 carp of 31lb+ and hundreds at twenty-pound plus. Since then DreamLake 2 simply got better when, in December 2001, a further 200 carp weighing in at over two tonnes including two fifty-pound carp were introduced. More recently, an additional one tonne of carp were added in October 2003, over 200 carp in November 2005 and yet a further 200 beautiful chestnut mirrors in November 2007. All have served to make an excellent water a simply awesome place to fish.\n\nDreamLake 3 opened in May 2000 and has quite simply gone from strength to strength. It's hardly surprising really as two tonnes of carp went into the lake in November 2003 - carp to over fifty-pound including 142 high-twenties, thirties and what we're famous for, numourous carp over the forty-pound mark! The combination of these specimen fish with the 600 carp present for the opening of the lake, as well as other prior stocking periods (100 carp December 2002 and 120 carp to 53lb 8oz introduced in December 2001) makes the over-all biomass of fish in this 8-acre lake quite incredible!\n\nOnly available to anglers on our Inclusive Package, DreamLake 3 offers anglers excellent 'action style' sport combined with every chance of a personal best whacker thrown in - the perfect fishing situation. Current records stand at 49lb-12oz for mirror carp, a colossal 81lb 9oz for common carp, the grass carp record is a staggering 56lb and 87lb for cat fish.\n\nThe lake itself is mature and tree-lined with 16 neatly presented log fronted swims and all with easy access, meaning DreamLake 3 provides ample room for the maximum of eight anglers accommodated each week. As you'd expect from this style of pit there are numerous gravel features within DreamLake 3, as well as weedbeds found across the depths that vary between 6-9ft. If you're new to DreamLakes, you'll also be pleased to learn that unlike many French waters the lake is free from crayfish or poisson chat - allowing you to maintain confidence in your hookbait without the need for netting or similar protection.\n\nDaily transport at meal times to and from the air-conditioned DreamLake restaurant is provided by your resident team of DreamLake Bailiffs. However, to save a short walk of approx. 1km, DreamLake 3 shares it's own on-site shop, shower and toilet facilities with adjacent DreamLake 4 and DreamLake 5.\n\nThe opening of DreamLake 4 in May 2000 saw the addition of over 200 carp to what was already an impressive level of stock. Since then a number of thirty and forty-pound fish have also been introduced, with a further 100 carp to 49lb going into the lake in November 2003. Not forgetting the stocking of 50 carp to 44lb (December 2002) and 40 carp in December 2001 - yes, you've guessed it, DreamLake 4 is set to create even more PB smashing moments for our visitors. There's a few lake records you'd love to see on the mat thats for sure - how about a common carp of 50lb or a mirror carp weighing at 50lb 8oz, not to mention the huge 118lb catfish and 50lb grass carp present.\n\nMature and tree-lined, this attractive 4-acre lake boasts eight rustic log lined swims - neatly presented and easily accessible, providing ample room for the maximum four anglers accommodated each week or up to six if booked as a group. With various gravel and weedbed features the average depth of DreamLake 4 is around 7-8ft in most places. As you will find with all of our lake there are no crayfish or Poisson Chat - so you can fish you're hookbait just as you would normally in the UK.\n\nBooking options: Onluy available to anglers on our popular Inclusive Package, DreamLake 4 offers anglers excellent facilities and everything they could wish for to enjoying a relaxing fishing holiday only interupted by plenty of fish playing action.\n\nAlso sharing with adjacent DreamLake 3, DreamLake 4 and DreamLake 5, you will enjoy the exclusive services of a DreamLake Bailiff and the lakeside facilities, which include a shop serving drinks, bait and tackle items, in addition to the existing shower and toilet facilities. Meals are served in the air-conditioned lodge at DreamLake 2 - just 1km down the lane. Although for your convenience and to save the short walk, daily transport is provided at meal times.\n\nHaving opened in late March 2004, DreamLake 5 lived-up to all expectations in offering some of the best carp and cat fishing action in France. Not surprising considering over two tonnes of carp to 50lbs, including nearly eighty thirty and forty-pound fish were introduced in Dec 2003. In addition, some of our bigger cats to 120lb+ have also been relocated to the new DreamLake 5. All of these beautiful, pristine looking specimens supplement the huge numbers of high-doubles and twenties, as well as the existing levels of thirties and forties.\n\nThis mature five-acre lake is tree lined lake yet contains eight extremely neat and well presented swims to choose from - accommodating a maximum of five anglers (or six if in a group), DreamLake 5 offers plenty of room to fish. There are no crayfish or Poisson Chat problems - leaving you free to explore lakebed features including gravel bars and weedbeds with your perfered presentation in water depths of between 7-9ft.\n\nWith over-winter feeding to encourage and maintain competitive feeding of the fish, the action at DreamLake 5 was set from day one! Current Records established in 2004, now stand at 48lb 8oz (common carp), 52lb (mirror carp) and 127lb (catfish).\n\nOnly available to anglers on our popular 'Inclusive Package', DreamLake 5 offers anglers excellent facilities and prolific fish action!\n\nThe lake also shares exclusive services with DreamLake 3 DreamLake 4 and DreamLake 5 of a DreamLake Bailiff and the lakeside facilities, which include a shop serving drinks, bait and tackle items in addition to the existing shower and toilets. Meals served in the air-conditioned lodge at DreamLake 2 are just 1km down the lane - however for your convenience and to save the short walk, daily transport is provided at meal times",

We are at present unable to say what size the Carp are in this lake as it has not been drained for many years.\n\nStock: We have seen some huge fish in the margins but are yet to catch them, it has been renowned for large Grass Carp and some of our visitors tell stories of being unable to stop some of the fish they have had takes from.

A 3 Hour 40 Minute drive from Calais. The owners are Kev and Jo Saggers who are a very friendly english couple and will help you in every way they can to make you feel at home and enjoy your trip. Etang de Chanet is a stunning and peaceful, 12.5 acre lake set in dense woodland. In 2006 the lake was drained and netted and then stocked with 2 tonne of virgin fish as well as the original stock from the lake. Nearly all of the new and already present fish were Mirror and Common carp ranging from 12lb to just over 45lb. Taking into account the average yearly growth rate some specimens could be tipping the scales at 60lb. Considering quite a few of these are still uncaught and untarnished virginal fish this should make for a very exciting and active season.\n\nAlso present in the lake are some pike which were re-stocked from the original netting. As to how big they are we are not sure but some nice specimens have been caught on pike fishing sessions at the lake. Etang De Chanet is also home to some beautiful wildlife including Jays, Buzzards and Kingfisher to name but a few. Lake: The Lake has 10 swims which have been carefully situated around the lake to provide a feature to fish to for each angler. For example islands, overhanging trees, margins lilies and also open water. The depths vary from 2 ft. – 8 ft. with a silt bottom. We welcome a maximum of 8 anglers per week, which will ensure a more intimate fishing experience for you and also provide the option of moving swims if desired. There are no poisson-chats present in the lake (a nuisance species of catfish which are present in some French fisheries. We all know there is nothing more frustrating than fishing all night with no bait on your hook.)\n\nStock: The rest of the stock consisted of a handful of wels catfish which at present time are estimated to be at around 40-50lb. Our newest edition to the lake is `Mandy`, a sexy specimen 70lb mandarine wels catfish whom we couldn’t resist buying down to her sheer beauty.\n\nThere is a cabin on site with full cooking facilities including oven, hobs & a big gas BBQ, freezer for bait (limited size) and electric points for charging phones, ipod docks and bait boats etc. There are also 2 english toilets and 2 powerful showers. We provide Carp Mats & Weigh Slings for every angler.\n\nBooking through website",

    "description": "Location: Set in the beautiful Loir Valley, 3 hours from port. Website: https://www.facebook.com/Etang-de-Janine-203886779633269/info/?tab=overview Description: Set in the heart of the Loire valley, Etang de Janine is only 3 hours from port, the lake is a mature 60 year old tree lined 18 acre gravel pit that is bordered by other lakes, maize fields and nearby flows the petit loir river. France does not get any more picturesque than this, and has an abundance of wildlife which includes, wild boar, deer, lizards, herons, kingfishers, woodpeckers; in fact the list is endless with hatfuls of birds of prey, owls and miles and miles of farm land. The nearest city is 30 miles away so you don't even have light pollution, sit at night and look up at the stars, fantastic! The bank side is mowed regularly, beautiful little flowers planted, trees kept plush and as we find a snag in the lake it is removed. Some of the swims are natural, grass that goes down to the water’s edge, some are cut out and edged off with railway sleepers. Because we are down in the valley there is normally a breeze coming from somewhere, and if not there are enough trees to shelter under when things warm up. There is a locked gate and the lake is fenced off, you can park your car behind every swim, so no mile hike with your tackle! the only vehicles we get here are the tractors out in the fields. With no factories, smells or noises. Peace and tranquillity is permanently at hand.\n\nLake: We are now into our first year, we have had some wonderful fish out. Lake depths vary from a general 10ft all over with cuts that go to 13ft, shelves that come up to 7 ft, the end by the shower and toilet have just received a good planting of lilies, the corner stays around 3-5 foot until you get to forty feet out where it drops down to 13 ft then comes up on a bar, the other side goes to 10 ft. Plumbing with a rod is worthwhile, you do need to think a little about your fishing here, it's not a supermarket type lake. Roger, the previous owner of Lyngors has fished Janine, formerly Etang de Vouvray for 8 years, he told me \"the first year I arrived I watch a common of around 40lb in the margins, this fish has had me return every year.\" At first, maize scored well but now boilies have come into their own, and looking at the fish's diets there is a change in the baiting policy for 2005. (see bait for details) There are four stone picnic tables that resemble a setting at Stonehenge! They are along the side of the lake and have been well received. There is no need to move from the water’s edge as we deliver breakfast and a home cooked meal, many a night we bring over some meat, salad and have a bbq, We supply you with clean water, bin bags, take all you rubbish away, There are clean hot water showers, toilets bankside, we charge you batteries/phone, boat, lights, we have freezer space for your frozen baits, but as we roll our own and they go into the lake regularly, we suggest you use these on a couple of rods. At present we have 3 boats available around the lake and have not had any problems with them, I will monitor the situation with them yearly, and then decide for 2006. Bait: NO NEED TO FILL YOU CAR WITH STINKY BAITS THAT WEIGH A TON AND TAKE UP ALL YOUR ROOM! Our home rolled baits are a quality food source for Carp, below is a list of ingredients used in their manufacture, showing how much thought, time, effort and expense we have taken to achieve the end product, we hand roll, hand boil and hand pack them. The Facilities: We have two large chest freezers so we can store your favourite baits, tell us what you need and we will bring it over with your next delivery of food. Daily we supply fresh water in clean containers for your tea - coffee etc. We recharge your batteries for you bait boats, torches, telephones and walkie talkies. In fact we have even jump started a car after the driver flattened his battery with a dvd player running to his bivvy! We often pick up the odd thing from the shops, like a case of beer, two bottles of wine and a toothbrush, so you can concentrate on relaxing! Lakeside there is four stone picnic tables and a couple of large wooden tables where you can sit and enjoy the very quiet countryside. We supply buckets for mixing bait. We also sell all the bait you will need. We remove rubbish daily, and supply bin bags. There is a clean hot shower and clean toilet lakeside.

    "description": "Location : Moulinots is located in the Champagne Region of France, 240 miles from Calais. The journey involves 2 motorways and 1 other road (final 15 miles to the lake), most anglers complete the route in 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Website :http://etangdesmoulinots.com/ Description : Moulinots is a picturesque 19 acre lake situated in a forest with no roads, railways or industry nearby, tranquillity is guaranteed. Although the lake is probably 200 years old, it was stocked and opened by Dave & Kathy Walsh as a carp fishery in 2002. The lake is surrounded by tall trees, shrubs and reeds, there are 19 swims and the number of anglers is restricted to 10 (+ Dave) ensuring that there is plenty of space for every angler. The lake has a silt bottom (though not deep silt), there are no nuisance fish i.e. crayfish, poisson chats or bream, the average depth of the lake is approximately 4 1/2 feet. Anglers are able to drive their vehicles to every swim. There is a lakeplan on the website with views from most of the swims. Fish Stock : There are approximately 300 carp stocked with an average weight in excess of 35lbs (1 of the best in France), 70% of the carp are over 30lbs and we estimate that there are 40 40's and 10 50's. The lake records (2009) currently stand at 56lbs (mirror) and 53lbs 6ozs (common). Detailed catch reports have been maintained since 2002, all information provided on catch rates, fish weights can be substantiated! Facilities: There is a large lodge located by the lake with a separate shower and toilet block. There are facilities available for charging electrical goods and freezers available (at the owners house) for baits etc. There is a large patio area for dining outside and within the lodge a dining area which can accommodate 10 anglers and a few guests (if required) in periods of increment weather. There is a food package available (not compulsory), quality and quantity, good old fashioned home made cooking. Other information: There is a free DVD available on request. If you fancy a visit to Moulinots you will probably need to book a year ahead, as 75% of the spaces available are taken by our regular customers a year (or 2) in advance. You may not have heard about Moulinots before, as we have not advertised in the last 4 years and have relied on recommendations, the problem these days is that our regular customers want to keep our little gem secret!",

This gives anglers plenty of room with some swims having the option of fishing the island and others having plenty of open water with various features to each swim from the obvious margins to overhanging trees, the island, various bars and troughs, gravel, sand and silt pockets. Lake & Stock: The lake was originally stocked with 170 carp in 2002. These fish were not fished for until September 2006 when I went there to do some test fishing. The fishing was obviously prolific with 50 fish averaging 21 pound caught in a short session of only fishing days. However, since then we have been piling the bait in including 1 ton of high protein carp pellet and the fish are growing very quickly with many of the original stock now being 28-30 pounds (January 2007). We have also added a further 60 carp, the majority of which were 30+ including several 40’s up to a brace weighing 46-8 each (common and mirror). These are all farm bred fish and are expected to put weight on quickly once on the pellet and bait. There are no poisson chats or bream to our knowledge, however we have caught several roach and rudd over 3 pound on small baits. One catfish has been stocked at 72 pound and there are apparently 6 huge grass carp that have yet to show themselves. Facilities: There are English style toilets and shower facilities at one end of the lake with additional toilets for the swims that are away from the main toilet and shower block. There is also facilities for charging of batteries for bait boats, phones etc. ETANG des \"DEUX PIERRES\" has added to one of the swims, known as \"The Beach\", a wooden cabin which can easily accommodate two bed chairs plus extras for that little bit of comfort and ease.

We took the opportunity of adding some additional features to the lake bottom. These consisted of introducing a new main channel that runs the entire length of the lake accompanied by smaller channels running from the margins to the main channel.\n\nAs the runs water of the complex it tends to have a greater number of the smaller fish however the lake record at present is a 42 mirror. There are also plenty of twenties and thirties to keep you occupied along with grass Carp to the mid forties and Catfish up to eighty pounds\n\nLake: At just over six acres in size, Etang Du Bois is the smallest lake on the complex. We class this lake as the runs water of the complex and it has been stocked to ensure that there’s always plenty of action day and night. There are seven purpose built swims and these have been positioned in between the reed beds or trees that line the margins. The swims are large enough to accommodate a two man bivvy and provide room for you to move around.\n\nThey have also been positioned so that they allow each angler his own clearly defined water. All swims allow you to fish from your own margin to the far margin without the worries of casting into someone else’s swim and also ensure that you can intercept the patrolling carp.",

    "description": "Description: If your idea of a great French Carp Fishing Holiday venue is a reed fringed, historic estate lake set amongst mature forest with beautiful features like lily pads, overhanging trees and reed beds, then look no further.\n\nThe larger lake is recorded as being in existence in 1833 but was originally created by the local monk’s centuries ago to breed carp for the table as were many of the best lakes in France. The carp are virgin fish as the lake has never been fished on a commercial basis by the previous French owners.\n\nThe natural surrounding give bags of features to fish to, from extensive lily beds to marginal rushes and fallen and overhanging trees, something for everyone regardless of style. Trois Fontaine combines all of these features with awesome fishing for carp to over 40lb, sensible rules and space and tranquillity that is hard to find on any venue.\n\nLakes: The two lakes at Trois Fontaine consist of a 21 acre mature estate lake and a two acre more recently built lake (still over 30 years old) that gives a variety of fishing, from feature rich margin to wide open vistas.\n\nStock: Mirror Carp of over 30lb are a common occurrence at Trois Fontaine, with a good chance of a 40lb+ specimen always on the cards, and the stock are piling on the weight year on year. We have carried out an extensive stocking program to complement the existing stock and we know that we have several 40's to crown the existing and introduced stock of 20's and 30's, one fish in particular is expected to top 50 this year.",

Bleu is a favourite with many of our customers who come back year after year for the sheer beauty of the surroundings, not to mention the personal best beating fish!\n\nAgain, you have the sole use of a bankside summer chalet, containing a gas supply, cooker, pots, pans, sink and patio table/chairs.A toilet is also present within 50 metres and a boat is available on request.

Heather Lakes are located in the Brittany region of France and are less than 1 hour from Roscoff and less than 2 hours from St Malo. We offer carp fishing trips on a week long basis, especially suited for \"Drive & Survive\" purists.\n\nMain Lake is the larger of the two lakes that we have on the complex. At around 2 acres of fishable water it is the ideal size to comfortably accommodate 2 to 3 anglers. The lake which is around 40 years old was dug for peat by hand and therefore has a varied bottom with superb features under the water surface. You can expect depths of 1 to 7 feet, most of which is silt with gullys and plateaus. Gravel areas, bars and weed beds are there for you to find and fish. The surroundings are all left as natural as possible with a wide selection of trees and bushes, grasses and shrubs that make the Main Lake a very picturesque lake to fish. The lake is fed by water that drains down the valley so even when it's hot the lake stays full and fresh. There are 4 swims on the lake that are easily accessible. The banks are just above water level so it is safe and easy to land and return the fish. All are single swims, perfect for the bivvy, rods and equipment. Each swim has its own unique underwater and margin features to fish to so there is no swim better than another. The lake has NO cray fish, poisson chat or any other nuisance species to pester you so when your bite alarm beeps you can feel confident that one of our big carp is feeling hungry!\n\nStock: Carp",

The row of central islands gives all anglers many islands, bars and features to fish to,and provides a good degree of privacy from the eyes of anglers on the opposite bank. Depths range from 2.5 to 10 feet, and bars and channels have been created at the shallow end. The water is snag and weed free, contains NO nuisance catfish, and very few crayfish. The South side of the lake is bordered by our own dense mature wood, which provides shade during the hottest part of the day, ideal for those who don't like too much heat & sun. The whole of the lake is bordered by mature trees, shrubs & hedgerows, with many overhanging the water. These are obviously magnets for fish, giving excellent margin fishing and opportunities for stalking, which is allowed, providing other anglers are not disturbed. The shallow end has a number of islands, ideal for summer stalking, although there is no fishing in the West bank channel. There are bars and a number of gullies at the shallow end of both arms. Lake: The Lake will comfortably fish six anglers. We will normally only take full lake bookings, but occasionally will set aside an odd week or two where we may be able to take smaller groups or individuals, but please enquire.\n\nBecause the lake is so heavily stocked, it may be necessary to run the aeration pumps for short periods, during particularly hot weather. This could result in the temporary closure of swims 1 or 12 & 13. Facilities: The main accommodation is just off the plan, to the left of the North (upper) arm and has a fully fitted kitchen, with full sized cooker, microwave, toaster, fridge and freezer. Cutlery, crockery, pots, pans & kitchen utensils are supplied. The lounge has easy chairs, table & bench, satellite TV & DVD player.\n\nThe bedroom contains a futon with three foot & four foot beds, plus a separate single divan. Bedding is supplied, free of charge. The veranda has a large table and chairs for outside dining, and anglers have their own hard standing car park for four vehicles, right next to the main accommodation. There is a small cabin shown on the above plan, on the Eastern end of the lake, at the back of swims 6 and 7. It includes a patio table and chairs, for inside or outside use. It will also be useful for storage of items not required on the bank. This cabin will comfortably accommodate two bedchairs.\n\nStock: Carp, Cats",

Four of the swims are on the islands. You can fish where you want and still look after less experienced anglers.\n\nIntroduction Joy Lake had been a predator water for 35 years until around 5 years ago. The original carp are big, but there aren’t many of them. We’ve redressed the balance; stocking carp from doubles to 40's. A high percentage of mirrors. Anything pike/zander-proof as long as it had the looks and frame to go big.\n\nIt’s a finesse water. Location and accuracy rather than distance will sort out the better fish. Plenty of action and a photo for the mantlepiece. The mirrors from the 2004 stocking are some of the prettiest fish you'll have seen. A good chance of a 30, maybe a 40, plus the unknown. It's easy compared with what you're used to - but with ample scope for stalking it'll be the working anglers that get the best results.\n\nFacilities Joy Lake is fenced and totally secure. English toilet and shower are contained in one cabin. A second cabin contains a small gas oven with hob, along with plates, cutlery etc for you to use. Mains water is connected and is fine for drinking! Finally, there is a stone barbeque for you to use when the weather permits.\n\nLocation Joy Lake is in central Brittany in north-west France. We send detailed directions when we know which port you're travelling to. Ferry prices vary enormously - it's anything from £50 to £500 to take a vehicle across the channel. We can help with ferry options if you want us to.\n\nApproximate journey times in hours: St Malo - 1.5; Caen - 2.5; Calais - 6; Le Havre - 3; Cherbourg - 3; Roscoff - 2; Boulogne - 5.5; Dieppe - 4.\n\nBait Fresh bait is available onsite without the need to pre-order. Our 7mm carp feed pellet is produced for French fish farmers. We sell it at 2 Euros/kg. Particles are freshly prepared - maize, hemp and parti-mix - all at 3 Euros/kg. Quality fishmeal boilies work best. We recommend you bring whatever you're having sucess with on your own water.\n\nRules No nuts. No braided mainline except on markers or spods. No leadcore. No Longshank nailer type hooks. 3 rods maximum. If you're bringing inexperienced carp anglers you'll do them a favour by recommending they stick to 2 rods.",

It’s owned by English couple John & Lesley London who live on site and are always on hand for help and advice. A maximum of 4 anglers can fish the lake but John prefers 3 as that gives you options to move around a little.\n\nBletiere gets its name from the French word for wheat, ble, because it was once part of a large cereal farm. The 2.5 acre lake sits in 16 acres of woods and fields giving you real seclusion. You reach the property down a long track and it’s totally enclosed by other fields and woods, not over looked at all – the feeling of exclusion & tranquillity is palpable. There’s always been a lake here - it can be found on maps back as far as 1833 – and over the years it’s been extended to its present size and shape",

It’s definitely a runs water and the positive feedback we get is enormous. No wonder people book their favorite peg one year in advance.\n\nThe lakes: The venue consists of 5 lakes with respective surfaces of 16 hectares, 12 hectares, 7 hectares, 8 hectares and 4 hectares. Grassy banks, overhanging trees, lily pads and some islands are the main features. The bottoms of the lakes are hard with gravel and sandy patches. The depth varies between 2 m and 2,5 m. There are no obstacles and no weed formation. Bear in mind that there are fresh water mussels. There’s a secure perimeter fence, which will give you a safe feeling.\n\nThe swims: Although there are 22 swims, the owner doesn’t want to have more than 25 anglers at the venue at any one time. This means that the fish will never be overstressed. The swims are large and have good access by car. All swims are doubles and swims 3, 5, 16, 22, 23 and 24 are big enough for 3 anglers.\n\nStocking: Due to the good management of the venue, La Carrière has an ideal stock of healthy and big carp. You can catch fish both by day and by night. The stock consists of 1500 carp between 20 and 50 pounds; several 30’ers and 40’ers are caught every week.\n\nFacilities: The anglers have at their disposal a kitchen, a dining room, a shower and a toilet. These are cleaned on a daily basis.\n\nBooking through: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=11",

A five acre stream fed Lake with depths near the source of three feet and at the dam end over twelve feet.

All are hard fighting fish and a pleasure to catch. The lake also contains fifty Catfish varying in size from mid teens to around 50 lbs . There is also a large head of Pike running to 20 lbs or more. These now compliment the existing stock of Carp some of which in 2002 weighed in the low teens. The lake also contains plenty of good sized Perch and Roach. NO poisson chat.\n\nFacilities:The chalet contains a few basic comforts in the form of cooking and washing facilities, a small fridge, food storage cupboards, table, chairs and a set of bunk beds (bedding not supplied).

When travelling from the North, exit the A71 at Saint Amand Montrond and travel to Culan on the D997. Driving times from the ports are approximately 5 hours and Airport travel from as little as 1 hour.\n\nLake: La Cour is a 15 Acre Lake surrounded by 22 Acres of pasture and woodland, in which 17 swims have been created around the periphery of the main lake which will accomodate up to 12 anglers at any one time to ensure you have plenty of room to manouvre and the opportunity to move around should you wish to. A smaller stock lake is adjacent to the main lake which Alan uses for stock rearing before introducing the fish to the main lake in a controlled manner. The farthest point of the Lake is wooded and this natural vegetation has been left to provide an area for the fish to spawn. The lake is spring and stream fed and undulates to 4.5 metres at its deepest point.\n\nStock: We are unsure of the total stock as we have never drained the lake to maintain the balance of the eco system. Prior to stocking we have caught several 30 and 40lb Carp so these could well be over the 50lb level by now! We have also stocked 2.5tonnes of carp (common and mirror) in total to 40lbs across the last 2 years to supplement the existing stock and have some lovely specimens now. The lake also contains perch, roach, zander and pike with fresh water mussels too highligting the quality of the water! Facilities: La Cour is now delighted to offer shower facilities. Meals and refreshments on request available at the Estate Lodge or down at your bivvy!\n\nOur 'Fly'n'Fish' package is proving very popular providing all facilities for your stay and transfers to and from Limoges airport.

    "description": "Location: Situated in beautiful rural countryside La Petite Martiniere can be found in North West France in the Pays de la Loire, region 53 Mayenne, close to the borders of Brittany and Normandy. There is easy access from / to all the major ports via the excellent road network both toll or free (you choose), you’ll find the driving far more relaxed and pleasurable than the cut and thrust of the UK. Calais is a 5hr motorway journey, whilst the nearest port of Caen is less than a 2 hr trip with various others in between.\n\nWebsite: www.carpfishingmayenne.com\n\nDescription: The area surrounding us is agricultural, with cows, sheep and horses grazing in nearby fields, and in season crops of Maize, Barley etc. an interesting fact of our area is that there are more cows than people; we have no immediate neighbours, no noisy main road close by, the gently rolling landscape is perfect for walking or cycling with our local village only 2 kms away, there you will find 2 boulangeries, a small supermarket, 2 banks, a bar / restaurant, a bar / tabac, doctors, pharmacy, pizzeria and hairdressers. The nearest town is Ernee (8kms.) which has large supermarkets, garages and a wide variety of other shops and services including a chocolate factory (with shop). Mayenne town is only 13Km boasting chateau, masses of shops and restaurants providing all you may need. With your booking confirmation we will include comprehensive directions including sat-nav codes to ensure a stress free journey to us.\n\n2010 sees the first year that the lake is available to the general public; previously it has been for the exclusive enjoyment of friends and family, the fish have been sourced and stocked with quality, rather than size or quantity as the deciding factor, although the Carp do go to 40lbs and Tench to 9lbs, along with size the stocking levels are generous to help with your catch rate, also the facilities have been built to a quality standard rather than price, so you will not be disappointed.\n\nAs with most French towns and villages they have weekly markets where you can find a variety of goods including locally grown produce. Further away (20 mins) you will find the city of Fougères home to the largest medieval castle in France, with the famous Mont St Michel, Normandy beaches etc. only a short distance further, or in the opposite direction Le Mans, Vitre, Saumur etc. are all within easy reach.\n\nBefore 2010 the lake had never been used as a commercial fishery, indeed it was originally constructed as an irrigation water source and source of food (they still eat Carp in France) for the then horticultural owners. It is a total of one and one half acres in size, with depths between 50cm and 180cm with the average depth around 140cm, it is spring fed at three separate points, allowing legal night fishing. There are 5 swims 2 of which are platforms and 3 hard standing, with the opportunity to set up from the banks in other areas, there is space on 2 of the hard swims for a double bivvy and the other hard swim will house a single bivvy.\n\nStock: In the winter of 2008 we stocked 13 Carp between 25 and 30lb, 20 Carp between 15 to 20lb, and 28 from 10 to 15lb, 12 Tench from 5 to 9lb, there are also Catfish to 30lb, a few Pike, Perch, Zander, Crucian Carp and Roach along with the Carp already in the water. In November 2009 we completed a partial drain down and netted the water to remove the bulk of smaller fish and most of the cats, at the same time we cleared tree roots and other possible snags from the margin areas. December 2009 saw a further stocking of 15 Carp between 30 to 40lbs and 25 between 10 to 15lbs.\n\nYou will find peace and tranquillity here as you enjoy your fishing, only sharing it with the local wildlife; which include resident red squirrel, Kingfisher and massive Buzzards that cruise effortlessly overhead on the warm thermals.\n\nFacilities: We offer exclusive use of our venue for a maximum of 3 anglers to include the use of our cabin, the chance to catch excellent condition fish from our carefully managed lake whilst enjoying the exclusive use of the facilities provided. If you (or partner) don’t wish to spend all of your time fishing there is plenty to do and see in the area. We live on site and are happy to help or offer advice, whether it is fishing related or not.\n\nBooking: Via their website",

It comprises one beautiful, intriguingly-shaped lake of nearly 60 acres, another of 6 acres and one mile of the River Yonne. Website: http://www.lesbeauxlacs.net/ Stock: There are about 400 carp in the main lake at present(January 2009) and this is made up of about 150 original fish and a further 250 that have been introduced (see website for details and pictures of some of the stock fish). We intend to stock another 100 fish in the not-too-distant future. A photographic record is being kept of as many fish as possible and this shows more and more originals still being caught. The current Labyrinth lake record was 57.4 mirror landed by Bob Nicholls in November 2008 and this is one of six different 50's landed in 2008. The lake record is not expected to stand very long and the fishery should produce its first 60 quite soon, especially as there has been several reliable sightings of at least one huge, original common! In addition to the carp stock, there are a few catfish present and although these average only 40lbs, a huge fish of well over 100lb was seen, hooked and lost, and soon adopted the name of the Minotaur (the guardian of the Labyrinth).",

    "description": "Location: Lies in the valley of the river Risle (Normandy), at an hour’s drive from Le Havre. Description: Lac de Grosley is a very attractive fishery that. This venue consists of 2 beautiful lakes surrounded by woodlands and fields. The lakes feature overhanging trees, reeds, lily pad beds and grassy banks. In 2008 the venue was taken over by Mr. Eric Touzé who is determined to create a top destination for carp anglers. If you’re looking for an easy runs lake, Lac de Grosley would definitely be a good choice.\n\nLake: As we said before, this venue consists of 2 beautiful lakes surrounded by woodlands and fields. The lakes feature overhanging trees, reeds, lily pad beds and grassy banks. The first lake has a surface of 12 hectares and in the middle there’s an island; the second lake has 4 hectares. They are both accessible from all sides over a gravel path. The venue has a secure perimeter and at night the entrance is closed.\n\nSwims: The property counts 17 swims spread over the two lakes. Swims 2, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18 and 19 are single swims; all the other swims are doubles. The grassy swims are nice, spacious and several swims have a table and a wooden chalet to store your tackle or make some food (with your own equipment). Some anglers put their bed chair in the chalet. All swims have access by car.\n\nStock: There's a natural stock that consists of mirrors and fully scale. Some are fat and heavy, while others are wild and strong, but they've all incredible coloring and you'll surely enjoy catching them. Although there are some small fish of less than 10 kg (normal natural stock) most carp are between 12 and 20 kg. The biggest fish was 22kg. You can expect more runs in the small lake because there’s more fish; overall they’re smaller than in the bigger lake. Because the venue is not well known, a lot of fish have never been caught before. That's why we wouldn't be surprised if bigger fish will be caught in the future.\n\nFacilities: Lac de Grosley offers excellent service. The bar and the restaurant are open from mid January until mid December; they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and you can order the meals on your swim. The clients also have a fridge, a freezer and a microwave oven at their disposal in the sanitary building. You can order fresh bread every day.\n\nThe venue also has a small tackle shop with all kinds of bait (particles and boilies) and small end tackle like hooks, lead, etc. Bait boats are for rent for 12 Euros per day.\n\nIf you need help advice or if you have any doubts during your holiday, you can always ask the bailiff. He's a very kind person willing to help you at all times. There are two sanitary buildings: one near the entrance of the venue and one behind swim 10. Supermarkets, bars, bakery etc. lie at 5 min from the venue.\n\nBooking through: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=12",

Stocked with carp and catfish over 50lb, these hard fighting fish are fast growing and we expect our first 60lb fish to be caught by 2007.\n\nLake: Lac de Lion is 5 acres in size, in a completely secluded setting in the Dordogne, surrounded by woodland and flat grassy banks, with swims around the whole lake allowing you to fish wherever you want. Free use of a rowing boat is provided for baiting up as required, with fish feeding well on beds of bait due to our feeding program. The lake ranges in depth from 5 metres to 1 metre, with the bottom made up of fine silt, sand and gravel. NO WEEDBEDS, CRAYFISH or POISSON CHAT, making it a very easy water to fish. The weather in this area of France is known for its hot summers and mild spring and autumn, leading to a longer fishing season and better growth rate for the fish.\n\nThere is a garage, bar, tabac and bakery 3 minutes from the lake, with the main town a further 5 minutes with a supermarket, pharmacy and usual shops.\n\nFacilities: Approximately 10 metres from the edge of the lake, the chalet is a large block building providing a kitchen with full size cooker, fridge with small freezer compartment, sink with hot and cold water (all the water pumped from our well to the chalet and passed as drinkable). All your cooking utensils are provided, as well as crockery, cutlery etc. The bathroom has a flush toilet, basin and enclosed shower with a good flow of constant hot water. The seating area has a corner bench with table which seats 6, a futon which seats 4 and can be turned into a double bed, if you wanted to stay in the chalet. A wood burner is provided with wood for the cooler evenings. Outside there is an awning above the French doors leading out to the lake, a wood table and chairs seating 6 with parasol and a fixed BBQ, allowing you to BBQ while socializing at the table and fishing. Next to the chalet is a small grassed area with a football net for recreational purposes.\n\nAwaiting summary information from above",

You can expect superb customer service, we like to treat our customers as we like to be treated and our standards are high.\n\nLake:\n\nThere are six good size swims that will accommodate two man bivvies and a double bivvy swim. All year round feeding of the fish is carried out in all areas of the lake. This not only ensures continued growth of the fish but also keeps them on the move.\n\nIn the main lake the water is oxygenated by a continuous replenishment from the natural springs below the lake bed, eventually draining off into the nature reserve behind the dam; this means flooding is virtually impossible. The stock ponds are fed from the same stream that supplies water to two local villages – the quality of water here is very high. The stock lakes have been established for around 75 years and hold many fish from decades gone by, the largest of which have been placed in the main lake.\n\nLac de Paix is a 1980’s clay digging and has been designed to satisfy anglers looking for a combination of runs – and sizable fish. We have achieved this by selecting an appropriate water to accommodate large carp and currently have around 5000lbs of top quality fast growing carp. There are also some sizable original fish. There are no poison-chat or crayfish in the lake. Lac de Paix is set in 10 acres of fenced, privately owned, breath-taking French countryside; surrounded by hundreds of acres of forest and farmland. Night fishing here is allowed and no permits are required.\n\nThere is easy access to all parts of the venue on foot, all pathways are well maintained",

Straight after Asnieres, the first dam wall that blocks this river Blour has created one of the most complete fisheries in France, a 100 acre lake called Lac de Villedon. Surrounded by grazing and slowly rising landscape your first view of the country side makes you relax and realise you 're holiday has really started.\n\nThe lake shows an old river bed, wandering around through the middle of the lake. This part is a bit silty. Most of the bottom towards the banks is clean and hard, you will hardly find any obstacles. Sometimes a rock or gravel bed make the features. From where the river enters towards the dam wall the depth varies from 1 up to 6 meters.\n\nThe swims at Villedon are very natural. You can reach them only by boat, which are for rent (with or without battery + motor) at the shop. There is plenty of space per fisherman; the average per swim is 5 acres per double swim! You can bivvy up, as long as they're green or camouflaged. Swims are pretty much soft and bank sticks will do the job.\n\nStock: Carp",

    "description": "Location: Troyes\n\nWebsite: http://www.charloucarping.co.uk\n\nDescription: Lac Du Charlou was purchased at the beginning of 2005 knowing that it had bag loads of potential to become a truly stunning location to bivvy up at and catch some very big carp. So, that is what we set out to do, and have now achieved our goal after a lot of hard graft, travelling, and also parting with a lot of hard earned money. The lake was named Lac Du Charlou after our two daughters, Charlotte and Louise, lucky beggars! Having been carp fishing to France enough times to know what, for me, makes a great week for a carper I wanted to put it in to practice by supplying this at a sensible cost, and enjoying it along the way by making it a week to remember for every visitor.\n\nLake: This stunning sixteen acre gravel pit has clear blue water, excellent for your photos, and is tree lined around the entire lake set within 24 acres of beautiful French woodland and countryside. There are some lovely views across the lake to lay and gaze at from your bivvy as the sun goes down in between catching your prize carp. Most anglers who have fished here also take home some lovely shots of the lake and its borders to remind themselves and show others just how nice it really is. The venue is nestled amongst some of the world’s most famous big carp waters on the border of the Orient Forest, home to Lac Orient and Lac Ammance, and I can guarantee you will be well impressed with the tranquillity of this one. The pegs, both double and single, are well spaced out for a maximum of ten anglers who will have ample room to fish with three or even four rods in certain pegs. There is plenty of space to bivvy up, with every peg being level and gravelled for drainage and comfort. Unhooking mats are supplied in each peg to lighten your load and care for our fish which are all in tip top condition.\n\nStock: The depths of the lake vary from 2 feet to 26 feet and the lake bed in mainly hard gravel with features to find and fish to. At present the lake holds over 350 carp, including mirrors, commons and leathers, ranging from 15lb to over 56b and growing fast! The nearest main town for everything you could possibly want is only a 5 minute drive away and includes a tackle and gaming shop which believe it or not sells carping gear. For those who do like to get away from fishing for a while can relax in the town at one of the lovely bars next to the waterfall in the town centre. Personally I would prefer to be fishing but at times it can get very hot in the Champagne region, and do not forget that you are also on holiday lads, and we will try our utmost to make it one to remember for you.",

The owners have retained its natural look with trees and bushes overhanging the water, giving shade and shelter to both anglers and fish.

The property is securely fenced in and there is a car parking area. Larry & Steve can help you transport your tackle to your swim if you wish.\n\nFacilities: There is a comfortable lodge overlooking the lake where breakfast and evening meals are served. The food package includes a full cooked English breakfast with cereals, toast and as much tea and coffee as you can drink... or a breakfast baguette delivered to your swim, and a two-course evening meal... main course and sweet. We're told nobody has ever left hungry, so be prepared to put on a bit of weight!!\n\nBreakfast & evening meals are served in the lodge… or, weather permitting, at the seating area overlooking the lake.

The lake is 5 acres in size and can be booked exclusively for up to 6 anglers, although individual non-exclusive bookings are also taken.\n\nLake: This beautiful lake is over 350 years old and is bordered by mature oak and traditional French poplars – an appearance that reminds one of an old English estate lake. It has many features including two islands, overhanging trees, reeds, bays, several sets of pads and a large channel between the islands and the hidden plateaus. It’s approximately 5 acres in size and is stream and spring fed ensuring good quality water throughout the year.\n\nThe banks offer easy access to the water and the swims have been designed to drain in even the wettest of conditions - no wellies required! They have been generously constructed to accommodate even the largest two man bivvies with room to spare and three of the swims have been designed as double swims allowing sociable fishing. One double and one single swim also have disabled access.\n\nStock: Hooked in France was initially stocked in the winter of 1998/9 with 130 fish. Most of these were low to mid twenties with a good head of thirties and a sprinkling of forties. In the winter of 2001/2 more fish were added including approximately 50 x 20lb+ mirrors.\n\nDuring the autumn of 2003 repair work was carried out on the lake banks which necessitated the fish being held in an adjacent stock pond. Angling Lines were there when the fish were re-introduced to the main lake.\n\nOn completion of this work an additional 50+ large fish were added, including 10 of 40lb+. The total stock is now around 240 carp which should give all guests the opportunity of some great catches. The lake record common is 52.02 & mirror 46.03... and there is a really big head of fish over 30lbs.",

We then give all new arrivals an hour or so to walk around the complex allowing you to ear mark potential swims. Once everyone returns to the patio the selection of swims/lakes will begin, with No.1 starting working through to the last drawn number Lakes: The 4 lakes themselves are all well established gravel pits which have been allowed to mature naturally. Most swims are enclosed by lush vegetation and the lakes' margins are lined with mature trees and bushes - perfect for the carp. In fact we've spent endless hours watching carp to over 60lbs browsing at our feet! The lakes are large enough to allow quiet, uninterrupted fishing without being too large to put the fish out of range.

    "description": "Description: The Lake being a 44 acre gravel pit in this estate is already famous worldwide for its exclusive shoot with exceptional management. It took us plenty of convincing to get the owner of the property to allow anglers on site. After 2 years of negotiations, the lake is now open for guests outside of the shooting season. The mature and tranquil lake is superbly shaped with plenty of features, islands and bays. The depths vary from 1m to just over 3m (10ft), given the shape of the lake, all features are within casting distance. Stock: The stock of carp has been established for quite a few years now, to say that our field testers were pleased is an understatement! From what we have assessed there are plenty of fish varying from upper doubles to mid forties, many fish display deep bodies and awesome scale patterns. The carp are still very naïve so the techniques to be used remain quite simple. La Livardière is not just another French venue, it is a special place where you can really enjoy the fishing and relax.\n\nFacilities: Are those expected for such a property, clean and functional. They are based in a renovated 18th century farmhouse just 50 yards from the lake. The property is fully fenced and secured; even the foxes cannot get in. The adjacent town of Le Mans has plenty of hypermarkets, shops, restaurants and entertainment\n\nBooking through: http://www.essexanglingholidays.com",

Situated in a rural and agricultural landscape, Margot is around 12 acres in size and within 2.5 hours drive from the port of Caen. It is possible to book the lake exclusively\n\nLake: 12 acres in size, Margot has 8 pegs for a maximum of 8 anglers It’s a relatively shallow lake ( 2 to 8 feet ) with a clay/fine silt bottom. The maximum distance you probably need to cast is just under 100 yards but most fish get caught within 30 yards of the bank. There are three boats on site which are available for your use.\n\nStock: Margot is owned by one of France’s most respected fish farmers, Michel Bigot... so as you can imagine the carp stocks are awesome. Put quite simply he has readily available what most lakes just cannot get their hands on – an almost limitless supply of big carp.\n\nThe current stock is over 400 carp up to 66lb. At least 100 fish are over the 30lb barrier and around 30 over 40lb. The current record is an awesome common carp that weighs in at 66lb. The Koi carp go to 36lb and the grass carp to 45lb+. The current sturgeon record is 67lb.\n\nBecause he is a fish farmer Michel regularly adds new stock and he did just this on the 24th of February 2009.\n\nIn total 70 large carp to 49lb and four Koi were introduced to this prolific venue. The vast majority of the carp were in the high 20’s to low 30’s with the jewel in the crown being a magnificent 49lb common, what a superb fish!! So now there are two very large commons in this famous lake including the lake record of 66lb. Quite a target to go for!\n\nFacilities: There is cabin on the bankside for the use of anglers which includes eating area, full kitchen facilities, English style toilet & shower.

The venue is part of a big farm and is surrounded by vast fields. There’s a secure perimeter so outsiders can’t simply walk into the property. Maurepaire has an outstanding stock of about 500 mirrors and commons. We notice that this lake is becoming as famous as Jonchery, Domaine de Brocard and La Horre. Lake: Maurepaire is open from the end of March to the middle of August; this means that during 6 months the fish are left alone… The lake has a total surface of 16 hectare (30 acres). The bottom is flat and consists of clay and a layer of silt. In the center of the lake runs the old riverbed; here it’s max. 2 meters deep. Apart from the lilies at the far end, there are no obstacles. The lake is relatively thin (between 100 and 200 meters) and a lot of fish are taken from the far reed lined margins. Baitboats are allowed to fish these spots. The venue has a secure perimeter, which will give you a safe feeling. There are 8 comfortable swims for a maximum of 12 anglers. Several pegs are wooden swims, others are graveled pitches. Take into account that there’s very little shade on the swims; about 25 meters behind the swims there are a few trees that can provide some shade. Swims 1 until 6 have car access, but after unloading, the car has to be returned on the parking. Swims 7 and 8 are accessible over a path. There’s a wheelbarrow to bring your tackle to the swim. Stock: Maurepaire has an exceptional fish stock of 500 commons and mirrors between 18lb and 58 lb.\n\nBooking Through: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=3",

Quickly that turns to anticipation, as you see and hear the big carp crashing out of the water around the lake. It is this combination of tranquillity, and the excitement of huge carp that makes Mayflower Pool so unique.\n\nMayflower Pool offers something for everyone, whether you are a seasoned carp angler, or someone on their first overseas trip. Combining superb fishing in beautiful surroundings, and or warm and friendly staff, we will provide you with memories to treasure forever.\n\nUntil 2003 Mayflower Pool was selfishly kept for our personal fishing. Now we are making this superb ten acre lake available to six lucky anglers per week. With nearly two acres of available water for each angler, there is freedom to enjoy your holiday to its maximum.\n\nMayflower Pool is set in beautiful, peaceful surroundings within the Corrèze region of France. Situated down a long no-through lane surrounded by woods and meadows, the lake is a haven of peace and tranquillity.\n\nLake and stock: At Mirror Pool Fisheries we have built our reputation on growing on big fish to become huge fish. To these ends, we drained the lake once purchased and all the existing carp and silver fish were removed. When that task was completed, we refilled the lake after liming and fertilising the lake bed. This was then left to stabilise before restocking.\n\nWe now only use one source for our lakes. Many years ago this fish farmer cross-bred high-backed Romanian carp with the local deep bellied fish, these carp, in the right environment, achieve phenomenal growth rates. We initially introduced over 200 of these young fast growing carp into Mayflower Pool. All carp were over 20lb with forty over 30lb, four over 40lb and one over 50lb. As we predicted, these fish have all grown on and we are seeing a spectacular number of big carp caught every week. A further stocking of over 100 large carp takes place over winter 2003/04.\n\nFacilities: Onsite facilities include toilet and hot shower, kitchen area and fridge. Our English bailiff has lived in the village at the top of the lane for the past three years and is always on hand to help and advise you when requested. Mayflower has undergone our usual fishery management improvements. We are not content with buying fisheries, putting more stock in with the existing fish then opening it to the public.\n\nWe can't promise you that you will achieve these results; however we can guarantee that the stocks are there for you to catch. For all the above reasons, together with Mirror Pool Fisheries reputation built over the past six years for providing fishing holidays to the highest standard, you can be sure of a holiday to remember.

We fully expect Meadow Lake to take on Mirror Pool as our premier water over the next couple of years.\n\nWe bought Meadow Lake in 2000 with the aim of making the lake a prolific venue where the angler would experience arm aching action from 20lb plus carp. This we have achieved with over 350 big carp stocked over the past twelve months, in addition to the existing stock present in the lake over the past twenty years.\n\nTo make the venue even more exciting we have stocked fifty-five catfish together with a number of 30lb plus grass carp.\n\nWe restrict the number of anglers to only six on this beautiful ten acre lake. This provides enormous scope to move swims or go stalking without feeling hemmed in by other anglers. Meadow Lake nestles in the folds of the surrounding hills providing unbelievable peace and tranquillity only overlooked by a solitary farmhouse.\n\nThe stock of carp introduced to the lake come from the same source as those introduced to our other venues. These large framed carp have shown exceptional growth rates and have put on up to 9lb of weight a year.\n\nFacilities: You can expect a holiday to remember at Meadow Lake with arm aching action in beautiful surroundings with only a small number of like minded anglers fishing the water at the same time as you. This, together with the on site shower, toilet and kitchen, provides you with all the facilities you would expect from a first class venue.\n\nBooking through: Their website",

    "description": "Millstone Pool\n\nLocation: Situated in the heart of the beautiful Limousin countryside, thirty minutes north of the Dordogne.\n\nWebsite: http://www.mirrorpool.co.uk/millstone.htm\n\nDescription: Is a seven acre lake dating back to pre-Napoleonic times. It is situated fifteen minutes from the city of Limoges and half an hour from the Dordogne.\n\nRob Green and Symon Osborne bought the lake in 1999 when the previous owners unexpectedly decided to put the property on the market. With a seven acre lake over three hundred years old which was stream fed together with a millhouse, barns and stock pond it was an opportunity too good to miss.\n\nSome of you may know Rob as co-owner of Mirror Pool fisheries. Symon and his father Tony have lived and fished in France for the past eight years. The fishery is owned by Rob Green and, Simon and Tony Osborne. All administration and bookings for Tony Osborne are carried out on his behalf by Mirror Pool Fisheries.\n\nThe fishery, once purchased, was netted and all the existing carp removed. We had access to a stock of high quality carp from one source. These fish were a result of selective breeding between the French carp and fast growing strain of Romanian fish. These hump backed carp have shown exceptional growth rates in the rich environment of Millstone Pool.\n\nStock: The lake holds a stock of approximately 180 large carp with the average weight over 30lb and at least 20 carp over 40lb and five different 50s two of which are commons. Millstone Pool is the perfect choice if you want the chance of catching your first 40lb or 50lb carp while still catching carp averaging over 30lb.\n\nOnly five anglers per week, fish of this quality and a stunning three hundred year old lake.\n\nBooking through: Their website",

    "description": "Location: Situated in the heart of the beautiful Limousin countryside, thirty minutes north of the Dordogne.\n\nWebsite: http://www.mirrorpool.co.uk/mirror.htm\n\nDescription: The beautiful Mirror Pool, set in tranquil surroundings and stocked with a massive head of big carp must make it the most sought after holiday destination. To ensure you have a fishing holiday to remember, we have warm and friendly staff always on hand to give help and expert advice. It was our intention at Mirror Pool to create the best small water carp fishery in France. Mirror Pool is four acres in size and is set in a wooded valley, situated in the heart of the beautiful Limousin countryside, thirty minutes north of the Dordogne. This stunning picturesque lake is similar to that most famous of lakes, Redmire Pool. If its peace and tranquility you are looking for, Mirror Pool won't let you down. You would be forgiven for believing that there wasn't another living soul within miles. At night you can relax, sit back and marvel at the millions of stars on view or listen out for the sounds of wild boar and deer that roam freely through the woods. Stock: Since being purchased Mirror Pool has been meticulously stocked with a large stock of big carp. There are currently seven fish over 50lb the largest two have now gone 62lb and 68lb 5oz, with approximately 20 fish over 40lb and with at least 60% of the remaining stock over 30lb with an average weight in the lake of over 35lb. Mirror Pool must be the premier water for its size in France and probably all of Europe .\n\nTo maximise your enjoyment, we limit the number of anglers to only four per week and we permit non-fishing wives and girl friends go free of charge. We provide legal night fishing and no additional permits are required. Each swim has a flat area big enough to take the largest of dome tents. All snags have been removed from the lake; the lake bed is of hard gravel with silt pockets and there is no weed to worry about. Additionally, the lake is free of the \"poisson chat\" (American Catfish), so there is no need to use hard boilies.\n\nFacilities: For your security, the lake is fenced off and your vehicles are parked on the complex close to your swim. We also have an English bailiff on site, who will happily give you advice on the fishing and the local shopping facilities and numerous sightseeing attractions. A shower and toilet are situated on the banks of the lake for your comfort and convenience.\n\nBooking through: their website",

    "description": "Location: Haute Nomandie, Eure Website: www.anglinglines.com/docs/ourvenues/lakes/molyneux\n\nDescription: Molyneux lies in the beautiful Normandy countryside and is very easy to reach being just 2¾ hours from Calais and 1¼ hours from Le Havre… and apart from the last ten minutes it’s all motorway!\n\nThe lake is nestled in stunning countryside far from noise and light pollution, the loudest noise being the birdsong that provides a peaceful backdrop to the fantastic carp fishing on offer.\n\nLake: The Lake is a genuine 13 acres, sitting securely in a 19 acre fenced plot. It’s around 40 years old, spring fed and the banks are lined with fully grown willow trees which have had plenty of time to mature. It’s truly a stunning water to fish with many anglers remarking on its beauty.\n\nThe lake is mainly snag free, except around the islands, which of course are hot spots, but are easily fished with a little application. There are no poisson chat and very few crayfish.\n\nWith a maximum of 6 anglers (8 if booked exclusive) fishing this 13 acre lake, there’s plenty of room for un-pressurised fishing. Switching swims is possible… some are double and one will even accommodate three anglers.\n\nBest tactics are often to fish to the islands over a small amount of bait… or to create a bed of bait in open water. With the open water tactic it sometimes takes a few days for the fish to move in, but once they do some very big hits can be had. The key to continued success is to then regularly top up the swim with bait. Rigs don’t need to be complicated, indeed simple and strong are the best choice.\n\nStock: In 1979 the lake was stocked with 80 mirrors and commons plus a handful of grass carp. These fish have grown on to become stunning, lean fighters which now average 30lb+, with some in the 40lb+ bracket. In November 2005 one and a half tonnes of new fish were added to the existing stock, ranging from 20 to 45lb… with one just tipping 50lb. These fish are of a fast growing strain and have spawned successfully. Finally in November 2006 another half a tonne of similar weight carp were added. There are also around 20 catfish in the lake between 15 and 20lb.",

    "description": "Location: Pays de la Loire, Sarthe\n\nWebsite: www.anglingfrance.com\n\nDescription: A truly outstanding venue for the family angler. That’s not just our opinion, it’s what our customers keep telling us – again and again. Whether you are an experienced angler just looking for a relaxed quality fishing holiday with the family, or whether you are a group of friends who fancy getting started on some bigger carp, Oakview caters for both. Tucked away in the country lanes of the beautiful Mayenne countryside, the two and a half acre lake with its luxury lakeside lodge is two and a half hours from Caen and five hours from Calais.\n\nAt the 2 lodge swims, anglers can enjoy a drink or a meal together on the lodge terrace without even having to reel-in. Oakview’s flat curving banks also make it comfortable for 4 anglers to tuck themselves out of sight and still have access to the island, margins and plenty of open water.\n\nThe accommodation often attracts family anglers, so the lake doesn’t tend to suffer from continuous pressure fishing. The 2009 season saw great catch reports from experienced anglers and countless PBs from those newer to the French fishing experience\n\nLake: The Lake was completely drained and de-silted in November 2007 and the carp were introduced in stages throughout 2008. It’s roughly pear-shaped with a central island in its bulge, meaning that 100% of the water is fishable and 4 anglers will all have attractive swims.The banks are grassed, flat and wide and mature trees surround the whole complex, making it a haven for wild animals and birds amongst the surrounding farmland.\n\nThe swims are located near each corner of the lake and each of the 4 main swims has a sister swim on its adjacent bank. So every angler can switch banks at any time to take advantage of changing wind and conditions. In the 2 home swims you can enjoy a drink or a meal on the lodge terrace without even having to reel in!\n\nThe lake bottom is mainly clay. There are deeper areas at both ends of the lake and a deeper trench running the length of the lake - so there’s plenty of underwater ridges and features to fish to. The depth range is between 4 and 7 feet and although the water level normally drops a foot over the summer months, there is very little silt, so there aren’t any shallow no-go areas.\n\nStock: Average size of carp stocked in November 2008 was 20lb 4oz. Average catch in 2009 was 25lb and the catch reports saw plenty of 30s on the bank. The 2009 lake record was 39lb 8oz and the most fish out by single anglers in a week were 37 and 21. Nuisance fish (small carp) were removed in July 2009.",

Vehicle access is possible along all of the fishing bank.\n\nIn the past Poisson Chat have been a nuisance in the summer months (mainly June & July) but they were hardly present at all in the 2009 season. Just go prepared in case they do make an appearance\n\nStock: The Lake does hold a significant number of original fish. These carp are mostly very dark mirrors, averaging around 25lb in weight, as well as a few smaller commons.\n\nAdditional fish were added in November 2005. This was followed by more stockings in early 2006. Each time only top quality fish were introduced - all handpicked by Mehdi. As the catch reports show the stock levels are very good - there's certainly no shortage of fish.\n\nTake a look at the catch returns and you’ll see that Old Oaks delivers a lot of 30’s... and we know of at least 4 different forties; a 43lb mirror , 40lb 6oz mirror , 42lb mirror and an immaculate 41lb common.\n\nPlastic corn above a bed of hemp and partiblend has proved to be a very effective method and a baitboat gives you a great advantage.",

Whether you prefer to sit behind your buzzers, heart pounding, waiting for that large pair of lips to gulp away your floating crust, or to see that float disappear into the depths, there really is something here for every kind of angler.\n\nLakes: Two pools in total seclusion and we mean total seclusion. Check this out and see if you could ever find what personal-best-angling has to offer anywhere else. The upper pool is around 1.75 acres and the lower being .75 acres, both pools start at around 2ft deep and slope off to around 9ft in depth.\n\nThe upper pool is sourced by springs and a stream which runs into the bottom pool. Both pools are tree lined which makes them ideal for stalking. As major underwater surgery has taken place both lakes at Kingfisher are virtually snag free.\n\nStock: The top pool has a firm bottom with the odd silt pocket here and there. The pool is highly stocked with grass, common and mirror carp ranging from 12lb up to mid 40’s, at least 15 carp over 30lb with an average fish weighing in at 22lb. Large catfish are also present and unlike most UK lakes (and many in France) these are very catchable simply because they can’t stop eating! Like the carp all catfish have been reared by personal-best-angling, the oldest being 10 years and weighing in at 70lb. Many other large cats are waiting to take your bait.\n\nThe lower pool is stocked with carp between 15lb and 40lb. With a softer bottom and over hanging trees this really is a carp enthusiast’s delight. Ideal for surface and float fishing, 1960’s carp fishing at its very best.\n\nBuilt in 1969 these pools were not touched for over 20 years and still surprise us with original stock such as a 38lb mirror gracing the bank.",

Website : www.petitpretre.com\n\nDescription: The lakes date back over 400 years when they were occupied by Monks – hence the name. They are referred to as Cassini lakes since they were first recorded during the reign of Louis XV who commissioned Ceasar-Francois Cassini of the famous cartographer family to produce detailed maps of France which listed Petit Pretre. Today Petit Pretre consists of 3 main lakes plus a small stock lake set in a mature 52 acre woodland setting offering a quiet and secluded location.\n\nStock: The main lake is about 7.5 acres which was excavated in 2007/08 with over 2 ton of common and mirror carp added weighing in at 30 to 50 lbs. The Gun Lake (our 2nd lake) is 5 acres and is being prepared now to be opened in spring 2010. It will also be stocked with a range of carp weighing to 50 lbs.\n\nLakes: We can accommodate up to 11 \"Drive & Survive\" anglers on the 2 lakes making it ideal for exclusive parties of 4, 7 or 11 people. The main lake can accommodate 7 anglers on 11 swims (8 single & 3 double). The Gun Lake can accommodate 4 anglers on 5 swims (3 double & 2 single).\n\nFacilities: We have excellent on-site facilities which include the Club House / Dining Room with recharging points, kitchen which we use for preparing on-site food and the shower / toilet facilities. All cabins are close to each other and the lakes. Lastly, we offer great bait packages for the fish and an excellent full board offering for our guests too – so nobody goes hungry.\n\nBooking information: www.petitpretre.com for more information",

Monsieur Denoual was a Parisian businessman - he'd bought Le Moulin Rouge to retire to. He didn't allow anybody else to fish it. All Madame Denoual knew was that there were \"beaucoup des grandes carpes\".\n\nThere are some stunning original fish. 9 years on and we still get first-time captures when somebody fishes areas that don't get fished. We've dripped in stock fish to minimise the risk to the originals. A handful of the original commons are 40's, with one going 50. One, bigger, that's never been banked. The bigger mirrors from the early stockings are overtaking the originals - 4 different stocked mirrors going 50, biggest so far 52lb.\n\nLake: Around 400 carp in less than 10 acres. You'd think it'd be easy. Sometimes it is. Most of the time it takes some figuring out. The lake's over 300 years old with plenty of natural food. They don't have to rely on bait to survive - so most don't get caught too often. That, little weed, few snags, and the level of care shown by Redmill anglers is probably why they're in such fabulous condition.\n\nDepth varies from 10 to 3 feet. Silty, with hard patches. The islands are an angler magnet (me too). Open water features are more subtle. You don't need anything more than a catapult to get bait where they feed. A spod can be useful used thoughtfully. Baitboats aren't fishing.",

There's a number of lily beds which not only add to the beauty of Remy but also provide good fish holding features to fish to.\n\nStock:330 carp with numerous fish over 35lb. Largest over 50lb\n\nFacilities:Remy is a carp anglers paradise set in wonderful woodland scenery, but the lakeside facilities are somewhat basic, consisting of a small wooden toilet block at the entrance. There is no running water or electricity but additional facilities, which include a hot shower, toilet, kitchen and sleeping quarters are available in the nearby village (2-3 minutes by car). Alternatively you could use the main club house on the nearby Jonchery lake which is about ten minutes away.\n\nBooking through: http://www.fishermanholidays.com/en/lake/detail.phtml?id=6",

Both have grassy banks which are ideal for setting up bivvies but the land surrounding Roseau is reclaimed marsh land and this means that during periods of heavy rain, particularly early season, it can get very muddy. Please go prepared. The swims are not accessible by car.\n\nLarge lake: This 12 acre lake is a great choice for the angler looking for non-stop action. It has an awesome number of fish with 20 runs a days more than possible. Average size is around mid 20’s - and there are lots & lots of 30lb+ fish. The record from the Large Lake stands at 50.06. There are 11 swims for a maximum of 10 anglers. Baitboats are allowed & these can be rented on-site.",

The lake is spilt up by two large lilly beds that offer sanctuary to the lake's residents during the summer months. The lake bed is hard and offers excellent bait presentation. Some silty areas can be found around the roots of the Lilly beds.\n\nStock: We currently know of fish up to 41lb 8oz, this is not to say that there is not larger fish hiding in Rosewater. The lake is unpressured and has never been fished on a regular basis. Fish from 20lb to 41lb oz have now been recorded and they are now putting weight on due to regular feeding.\n\nFacilities: In addition to four large bivvy pegs we have the lakeside house for you to enjoy during your stay. The house is of solid construction and has gone though a complete renovation during 2005/2006 and now offers the following:\n\nAll you need to bring if you wish to use the kit on site is your own reels, buzzers, sleeping bags and scales! Weekly Rates - What you get?? Included in our rental rate is the full and private use of the lake, gite and forest. We supply 6 carp rods, 3 bivvies, 4 bedchairs, bank sticks, slings etc. All you need to bring is reels, buzzers, terminal kit and sleeping bags.

    "description": "Location: Champagne Ardenne, Aube\n\nWebsite: http://www.anglinglines.com/docs/ourvenues/lakes/gigantica/index.php\n\nDescription: In September 2008 the venue which used to be known as St. Christophe was bought by Danny Fairbrass of Korda. He has changed the name to Gigantica .Gigantica lies in the Champagne region of Eastern France, around 4 hours from Calais, with the majority of the journey being by motorway. The lake is around 35 acres in size and is a cobalt blue gravel pit. It’s a true specimen hunters water – there are some truly exceptional carp swimming in its clear, aqua blue water\n\nLake: Gigantica is 35 acres (14 hectacres) of water... the water is cobalt blue because of the heavily alkaline gravel it has been dug from.Depths range between 18 and 25 feet, there are no ‘deep holes’ contrary to rumours from anglers. The bottom is fairly flat with very few lumps and bumps, it is therefore better to establish a baited area at a comfortable range and then stick to it.\n\nStock: Gigantica’s stock is still uncertain... the old owner boasted 950 fish; we can neither confirm nor dismiss this. As the season unfolds more and more carp are being caught which we personally have never seen before, this is because the old owner never kept any stocking records or catch reports\n\nFacilities: The old shower and toilet have been made into a ‘wet room’ which has been totally rebuilt and tiled to a very high standard... ‘too good for carp anglers’ was the tiler’s comment! The wet room has a large shower with free shampoo and shower gel along with a separate ‘posh’ sink. You can lock yourself in for total privacy and it is heated",

Depths vary from 1 metre, where the stream enters, to up to 5 metres at the dam end.\n\nLevels are always maintained in the lake by the incoming streams and also by springs that can be seen bubbling from the lake bed. In the severe drought in France, in summer 2006, when many lakes actually dried up, sweet chestnut lake retained it’s full height\n\nThe lake bed has a combination of hard areas and silt, and there is no significant weed or snags.\n\nHalf of the lake has lovely flat grassed banks, level with the waters edge. The remaining half is left undisturbed as a wild life haven.\n\nThe lake is surrounded by native woodland . The predominant tree species being Sweet Chestnut and Oak with Birch, Alder, Poplar and Willow also in abundance. Beneath the tree canopy is a profusion of other native vegetation, including Gorse and Broom. Orchids have been seen growing in the shade of the trees.\n\nStock:In November 2006 and early January 2007 the lake was stocked with half a ton of 'Royale' strain Carp, from 20lbs to over 40lb's, supplied by premier french fish dealer Simon Horton. These immaculate fish have not seen a hook and have never been fished for, they are gorgeous specimens, mostly mirrors, and are just waiting to be caught.\n\nSweet Chestnut Lake has not been emptied for over 20 years and currently supports a healthy range of fish species. These include original Carp, Tench, Pike, Zander, Chub, Perch, Roach, Pumpkinseed and wild Trout. The lake is free of Poisson Chat and problem Crayfish.\n\nWe know from the previous owner that the lake contains 50 original carp and a further 50 have been introduced by him over the last 6 years. These are predominately commons and the original fish may be over 35 years old. The biggest carp recorded from the original stock is a 30lb 13 oz mirror. Last summer we spotted a group of over 80 of these carp basking on the surface, these included some 20 lb plus fish.\n\nWe are very much a ‘Runs Water’with plenty of carp of all sizes.\n\nFacilities:The apartment itself is contained within the main house and has recently been refurbished and decorated to a high standard. It is a small self-contained, first floor open-plan apartment with a a small well equipped kitchen, separate bedroom and en-suite bathroom with English toilet and shower.\n\nThe accommodation is situated on the lake side, less that 10 metres from the water’s edge. Access is by way of an external stairway with a small viewing balcony and french doors to the living/dining area.\n\nOutside the apartment exclusive to our guests, there is a lovely area with a table, chairs and parasol, ideal for sitting out and relaxing. Below this, accessed by natural steps, on the lake’s edge, is a hardstanding which can also be used and you can even fish from here if you like.\n\nBooking information:Booking Info - http://www.sweetchestnutlake.co.uk/calendar.htm",

Not a word I like to use to describe the lakes, as it tends to paint a picture of exactly what I've bee trying hard to avoid here.\n\nAngling pressure has been kept to an absolute functional minimum, in order to preserve the lakes and the angling, and it has now become a real pleasure to fish these un spoilt waters, surrounded by such a variety of wildlife found in and around the natural aquatic environment.\n\nSmall groups of anglers only, which means each angler has plenty of water to fish, which should make a nice change for lots of you who fish in France",

The land is comprised of 45 acres with two lakes of 7 & 15 acres. Previously a nature reserve for 15 years, the Sanctuary Fishery has never been fished before.\n\nThe Sanctuary Fishery will appeal to individuals who are enthusiastic & dedicated about their fishing, enjoy their surroundings & appreciate the calm & tranquility of the countryside. We strive to maintain the ambience of the fishery to benefit both the angler and wildlife. The abundance of native wildlife has to be seen to be believed, from deer visiting the waters edge to barn owls hunting in the evening light, the fishery truly lives up to its name.\n\nThe largest lake is at the present being used for “growing on” over 400 stunning carp, which in the rich waters are gaining weight at a phenomenal rate, we are working on this lake at the moment and we will keep you posted on the opening date.\n\nLake: The lakes are situated on a limestone, clay ridge thus creating an abundantly rich environment for both fish and aquatic life. The lakes are teaming with dragon fly nymphs, damsel fly, shrimps, snails, swan mussels, daphnia and blood worm.\n\nWe have been recording weight gains of some fish in excess of 11lbs in 10 months, which is based on a natural food only diet.",

    "description": "Etang de VAUMIGNY Location: Situated 90-minute’s south of Paris by car.\n\nDescription: Etang de Vaumigny is an 80 year old gravel pit of around 37 acres (15 hectares). Frank, the owner and full-time carp angler has created a first class carp fishery with a healthy stocking. Every year Vaumigny brings us new surprises, just like the 26,6kg fish that was landed in the 2009 season. We look forward to seeing what happens next year… The Lake: Etang de Vaumigny is an 80 year old gravel pit of around 37 acres. The venue consists of 3 lakes: a nursery lake, a cat fishing lake and a carp fishing lake. The property has a secure perimeter and is surrounded by woods and fields. The depths of the carp fishing lake vary from 1,50 to 3 meters. There’s plenty of natural food like crayfish, mussels, worms and larva. The lake features overhanging trees. The hard gravel bottom has hardly any obstacles. You might find some trees and stumps near swim 10 and the peninsula. When you arrive, ask the owner, he’ll tell you exactly where the obstacles are. Frank visits all the clients to see if everything is alright and if you wish he gives you some interesting tips… There’s no weed in the lake. The grass carp eat a lot of weed and every spring the lake is treated to prevent the weed from growing. Boats are allowed, but they have to have a hard bottom and the use of life vests is compulsory. You can rent boats on the site for 70 Euros per week The Swims: The Lake has 18 swims around its perimeter. Only 16 swims can be used at the same time, which gives you the possibility to move around a little during your stay. Swims 1 to 9, 15 and 16 are doubles, the others are single swims. Vehicle access is good around most of the lake; swims 8 to 14 however are only accessible by foot. There are trolleys to carry your tackle to these swims. At Vaumigny it isn´t possible to pre-book a swim, when you arrive you can choose your swim with Frank. There are enough swims for everybody, so the last one that arrives, still has enough swims to choose from. The fish are all over the lake, so all swims are quality swims. Fish Stocks: In 1997, when the actual owner took over the property, the fish stocking was very poor and the original fish were very difficult to catch. To improve the fish stock, since 1997, every year new carp has been introduced to the lake. It doesn’t surprise us that, due to this fantastic management, half of the carp weigh over 15kg. We know from local anglers that at least 5 original carp were over 20kg before Frank arrived. Frank is convinced that now there are at least 36 carp over 20kg in Vaumigny. Besides carp, you’ll also catch grassies, sturgeon and cat fish. By the way: the biggest catfish, called Stéphane, weighs more than 85 kg… Don’t complain that we didn’t warn you… Facilities: There is elementary sanitary with shower, WC, washbasin and electricity. There’s also a washing machine, fridge and freezer. There’s WIFI for the clients.\n\nBooking though: www.fishermanholidays.com/en/",

    "description": "Description: \"Les Vaux\" or the Etang du Moulin des Vaux, to give it it's full French name, is a superb stone built mill house that dates back to the 16th Century and is set in the lush green countryside on the borders between Brittany, Normandy and the Pays de la Loire. It is approximately 2 hours from the ferry port of Caen and 1½ hours from St. Malo. The very pretty private lake that lies next to the house dates back over 300 years and had never previously been used as a commercial fishery until it was purchased in 2002 by its English owners, Chas and Josie Cook, who have restored the lakeside house to a very high standard and stocked the lake with fish. The accommodation and venue has been specifically designed with the family in mind.\n\nLake: The Lake is of approximately 3½ - 4 acres of open water with just over ¾ acre of marsh land at the top, where the Category 1 trout stream enters the venue. It varies in depth from 4.5 metres at the dam wall to 50 cms at the shallow top end. The average depth in the centre along the original river bed is around 2.7 to 3m, with margins averaging 1.4m to 1.7m. Access is by foot around three quarters of the bank side, where there is ample space for anglers to set up rod pods and bivvies should they wish to do so. All the swims and access to them are suitable for the wheelchair bound angler. Portable barbeques are available for use in each swim. The bed of the lake varies a great deal, from stone to sand to gravel, with silt deposited along the stream bed, as would be expected. The origin of the lake was as a quarry, with the extracted stone used to build the 500 years old church in the nearby village. This extraction has left a number of quite defined steps on the lake bed along the house side bank, whereas the far bank is predominately sand and gravel.\n\nStock: The lake was stocked in 2003 with around 280 carp... mirrors, commons and koi. The majority of carp now range from 20 to high 30’s, with the lake record currently standing at 47lb 10oz. Any small carp that may be caught will be from the original stock, or will have bred since the owners acquired the venue and will be removed to the stock lakes to grow The lake was stocked in 2003 with around 280 carp... mirrors, commons and koi. The majority of carp now range from 20 to high 30s and low 40s, with the lake record currently standing at 47lb 10oz. Any small carp that may be caught will be from the original stock, or will have bred since the owners acquired the venue and will be removed to the stock lakes to grow on.\n\nEfforts were made to stock good quality fish, heavily scaled mirrors and linears, plus commons. All stock is of the fast growing Czech Royale strains.",

    "description": "Description: Vinçons is a truly beautiful 12 acre spring fed lake situated on a working farm. The setting really is idyllic, quiet and rural, in one of the loveliest regions of central France. The lake is quite literally stuffed full with carp & most guests catch more fish than they ever thought possible. Add this to a choice of two types of accommodation and the use of a swimming pool and you can see why Vinçons has been one of our most popular destinations since 2001.\n\nVincons lies in the very picturesque region of the Cher, near the town of Bourges and takes around 5 hours to reach from Calais. The lake is sited within the grounds of a working farm which is owned by the Bouchot family who grow cereal and breed wild boar. This venue was \"discovered\" by us and had never been available for fishing before.\n\nLake: The first serious fishing session in July 2001 saw three anglers catch 186 carp in just one week! This consisted of 29 fish of 20lbs+, 150 doubles and 6 singles. The largest fish was 28lbs - fabulous fishing ........ and believe us it hasn't slowed down since! Catches of 30 carp in one day is not uncommon.\n\nThe lake is available for exclusive bookings and includes the on-site accommodation. This venue would ideally suit the discerning family angler looking for true peace and quiet. The fishing action is fast and furious and the virgin carp relatively easy to tempt. We suggest a maximum of 4 to 6 anglers, since although it is 12 acres in size it is so \"natural\" that there are very few fishable swims.\n\nStock: Stocked equally with common and mirror carp, the fish have thrived in this very rich environment and successful spawning has lead to a very impressive head of fish indeed. This really is an action packed water with takes coming all the time - thirty fish in one day is not uncommon! The carp are still relatively \"naive\" so there's no need for sophisticated tactics - simple hair-rigged boilies are quite sufficient.\n\nThe average carp is in the 18 - 24lb bracket but there are lots of fish in the high 20’s too... the largest fish to date has been 32lb. They must rate amongst the hardest fighting fish we have ever caught – they just don’t know when to give up!",

    "description": "Location: Brittany, Ille et Vilaine Website: http://www.anglinglines.com/docs/ourvenues/lakes/watersmeet/index.php\n\nDescription: Watersmeet has become a firm favourite with our customers who are looking for excellent accommodation on the banks of a private carp lake. This really is a peaceful, secure location … and the fishing isn’t bad either!\n\nWatersmeet is a beautiful mature venue consisting of two lakes - one specialist carp lake and one smaller coarse lake. It is superb for a family, or a small group of up to 4 anglers, who are seeking quality fishing in tranquil surroundings with the added bonus of excellent lakeside accommodation in the form of a lovely renovated cottage which sleeps up to 6. Watersmeet is situated in NW France, in the Mayenne region, amongst lovely countryside near the village of Larchamp. Approximate driving time from the port of Caen is 1½ hours.\n\nLake: The carp lake is 2.5 acres with an average depth of 1.5m and a deepest point of 4m. It’s a drainable, spring fed lake with a clay/silt base, lily pads and overhanging branches which are present on the near and far side margins\n\nThe coarse lake is one acre in size with an average depth of 1m. Again it is a drainable spring fed lake with a silty substrata and overhanging branches. This lake is heavily stocked with small carp of 2 to 3lb (including a few 20lb+ surprises!), roach and rudd.\n\nStock: The Lake was first stocked in February 2004 with just under a ton of carp averaging 25lb, koi to 20lb, Wels catfish to 50lb and grass carp to 25lb. A further stocking took place in December 2005 of 6 x 30lb+ commons & then the most recent stocking took place in December 2008 when over ½ of a ton of carp were stocked with an average weight of 28lb.\n\nIn total there were; 7 x 30lb+.... biggest 35.5, 14 over 27lb",

    "description": "Location: This exclusive holiday venue is situated in the Mayenne region of France. Our village, Bouchamps Les Craon is five hours drive from Calais, two hours from St Malo and four hours from La Harve, and just five minutes from the town of Craon\n\nThe Lake: Two acres in size, set in eight acres of meadow, damned at one end the lake is fed by many underground springs. It is lined with Willows, Silver Birch, various shrubs and Iris Reeds. At the damn end the depth is about ten feet, going back to four feet at the house end. The far bank is meadow with Iris Reeds along the margins.There are four swims on the lake, all being on the near bank. The lake bed is made up of gravel and sand and a little silt at the shallow end. The lake was de-silted in 2002 when 8000 tons of silt was removed. There is a small patch of lilies in the middle of the lake. All the swims are gravel based for your comfort.\n\nThe lake is virtually snag free, but we recommend a minimum of 12lb breaking strain line. The fishery is suited for 3 anglers, each with a three rod set up.We stock Nutrabaits 'Trigga', and a selection Dynamite Baits product, also pellets and seeds which can be pre-ordered. There is a small rowing boat available for your use if you require it. (use at your own risk).\n\nNo permits are required and night fishing is permitted.\n\nStock: When the lake was drained in the Spring of 2002 the fish stock was mainly small fish of various species. These were removed and given to the local fish farmer. Once the lake was de-silted and limed the sluice gate closed, the lake quickly filled.\n\nThen, in the Winter of 2002, the lake was stocked with forty-five carp between 16lb - 28lb and five carp of 29lb - 33lb. In December 2003 we added a further 39 carp to 28lbs (17 x 20-28lbs and 13 x 17-20lbs) plus 9 Grass carp to 25lbs, and some pike.The total stock is over 80 fish. The average weight of stock now being 20lbs+. These have been fed on carp pellets throughout the Winter months.\n\nIn Febraury 2005 we added 2 Mirrors of 42lbs and 44lbs and 6 fish of 35lbs - 38lbs to compliment the existing stock, also 15 Catfish between 10lbs - 15lbs and two of 30lbs, one of these larger Cats was caught during a netting sesion in the winter of 2006, and weighed 49lbs! We also removed over 1 ton of small carp. 2007 has seen some very good catches so far and 2008/9 is looking even better!!",

The Venue has been set up to cater for families with children or fishermen requiring more comfort than just a bivvy. Willow Lodge is located between the towns of Parthenay and Poitiers in the Poitou-Charentes area of France. Carp Fishing in France\n\nLake: The lake is between 4 and 5 acres and was originally dug in 1966 but re-shaping work was carried out in 2003. Depths vary from 3 foot to 9 foot. Over the last 3 years the lake has matured nicely, rushes, reeds and various bankside cover now border the lake although various attempts to plant lilly pads have failed as the fish love to rip them up !!!\n\nThe bottom is mainly flat but raised areas, stoney areas, silt, a couple of bars and a nicely shaped gulley give plenty of underwater features to find. There are also over hanging trees on the island to fish to and a spit that splits part of the lake towards the island, there is also a small back bay with an island that the fish like to visit for some peace and quiet !!!\n\nThere are 5 main bivvy swims which have solar lights to mark the waters edge, picnic benches and places to hang up unhooking mats.",

    "title": "Lac Du Charlou (Charlou Carping)",
    "location": "Troyes",
    "description": "Description: Lac Du Charlou was purchased at the beginning of 2005 knowing that it had bag loads of potential to become a truly stunning location to bivvy up at and catch some very big carp. So, that is what we set out to do, and have now achieved our goal after a lot of hard graft, travelling, and also parting with a lot of hard earned money. The lake was named Lac Du Charlou after our two daughters, Charlotte and Louise, lucky beggars! Having been carp fishing to France enough times to know what, for me, makes a great week for a carper I wanted to put it in to practice by supplying this at a sensible cost, and enjoying it along the way by making it a week to remember for every visitor.\n\nLake: This stunning sixteen acre gravel pit has clear blue water, excellent for your photos, and is tree lined around the entire lake set within 24 acres of beautiful French woodland and countryside. There are some lovely views across the lake to lay and gaze at from your bivvy as the sun goes down in between catching your prize carp. Most anglers who have fished here also take home some lovely shots of the lake and its borders to remind themselves and show others just how nice it really is. The venue is nestled amongst some of the world’s most famous big carp waters on the border of the Orient Forest, home to Lac Orient and Lac Ammance, and I can guarantee you will be well impressed with the tranquillity of this one. The pegs, both double and single, are well spaced out for a maximum of ten anglers who will have ample room to fish with three or even four rods in certain pegs. There is plenty of space to bivvy up, with every peg being level and gravelled for drainage and comfort. Unhooking mats are supplied in each peg to lighten your load and care for our fish which are all in tip top condition.\n\nStock: The depths of the lake vary from 2 feet to 26 feet and the lake bed in mainly hard gravel with features to find and fish to. At present the lake holds over 350 carp, including mirrors, commons and leathers, ranging from 15lb to over 56b and growing fast! The nearest main town for everything you could possibly want is only a 5 minute drive away and includes a tackle and gaming shop which believe it or not sells carping gear. For those who do like to get away from fishing for a while can relax in the town at one of the lovely bars next to the waterfall in the town centre. Personally I would prefer to be fishing but at times it can get very hot in the Champagne region, and do not forget that you are also on holiday lads, and we will try our utmost to make it one to remember for you.",

The majority have starburst scales, incredible colouring and sturdy bodies. They are powerful fighters and you will enjoy the challenge of catching them. You may have the chance to catch your personal best carp at Lac du Pelerin. Our carp range between 20 and 40lbs. The potential catch for anglers is exciting.\n\nThe lake is accessible from all sides and there are grassy banks to bivvy up right on your rods & watch those lurking carp. The lake extends to a little over 5 acres of fishable water. The water quality is superb and the lake bed has a good natural food source - we even have swan mussels, just shows how rich and clean our water is! All this and enclosed by mature woodland - Brilliant!\n\nThe features extend over the complete lake - an island, with willow trees & reeds, a lake bottom with many humps & troughs and a small riverbed which gives a good source of blood worms, snails etc. The depths vary from 3ft to 12 ft which means the carpest can cover all eventualities with three rods. We are establishing a lily pad bed which will just enhance Lac du Pèlerin's beauty and give the resident dragonfly, frogs and damsels somewhere to explore, along with the mirrors & commons of course. To compliment the water chain at Lac du Pèlerin other species such as tench, roach and zander balance the natural cycle.",

    "description": "Description: Lac du Val is around 4½ acres & set in northern Normandy, less than an hour's drive from the ferry port of Caen. The privacy of the site allows peaceful and tranquil carp fishing in lush rural surroundings for a maximum of five anglers - it is possible to book the lake exclusively.\n\nLake: The lake, which opened as a commercial fishery in 2004, is of the small Estate lake type surrounded by grassy banks, dammed at one end and with two islands providing a natural haven for the carp at the top end. It is fed by a trout stream so the water quality is excellent.\n\nThe depth varies from 3m at the right hand end of the damn wall, averaging 1.5m in the centre, down to as little as 50cm in the shallows by the islands at the top end.\n\nStock: The current stock is over 200 carp and the largest resident, a magnificent common, goes to 62lb 2oz!\n\nThe water currently has at least 30+ thirties and 15+ forties and 4 known 50+’s... and this number is increasing all the time.\n\nDavid has stocked the lake himself and has followed a policy of introducing good quality fish in small batches and these have now grown to a very good size. The first batch of carp, stocked in 2000, were all mid to upper doubles and these fish now make up the bulk of the 20's in the water. Since then fish have been added on a regular basis, with a batch of 22 fish added in January 2004 - all these fish were over twenty pounds. In February 2004 a further 24 carp were added - 5 x 30lb, 15 x 20lb, 3 x big doubles and a cracking 43lb common. Finally in October 2005 a 52.04 mirror was stocked.",

    "description": "Description:Lac du villefond is a mature 8 acre carp lake, and has been a fishery since the 1930’s; in 2008/09 it has been open to the public. It has access all the way around, with 8 purpose built swims including one double. There are over hanging trees and shrubs ideal for stalking and great to fish too. There is a tree lined island reachable from most swims and plenty of snag free open water. The bottom is hard clay with minimal silt. The fish are fed on our high protein pellet all through the winter so the fish have many months of unpressured feeding. To ensure a high nutritional value in the bait used we do require all pellet to be brought on site this is primarily to ensure the fish grow at a consistent rate and remain fit healthy as well as hard fighting. The pellet used has been the fish's main food source since they were stocked in the lake and the catch results using this pellet are best described as prolific. This pellet can be paid for when booking the lake or on an as when needed policy once you have arrived.\n\nStock:The water is rich with natural food and holds in addition to the original fish which go to 30+ including a couple of very large koi carp, a stocking of 200 carp over the 20lb mark. The 200 carp stocked include mainly mirrors with some leathers and some commons including the lakes largest carp stocked at 48lb! Along with the carp stocking, catfish to 66lb were stocked and sturgeon too over 30lb! Also there are coarse fish and large pike in the lake.\n\nFacilities:On site there is a small car park and facilities include a shower, English toilet, kitchen with cooker, freezer. There is access to battery charging and bins are provided at each swim also a row boat is available for use.",

    "description": "Lac les Pins is set amongst Pine Trees in a most stunning and idyllic location, where you will be able to enjoy the tranquility and relaxation it offers. We acquired the lake from the French owner at the end of 2003. He had used the lake and surrounding area over the years for the hunting of wild boar. The lake is in a very secluded location, but you may spot a deer at sunrise and sunset, visiting and drinking from the lake. We have yet to see a wild boar, they are possibly hiding in the surrounding enclosed mature woodland, but there is plenty of other wildlife around to give that added feel of getting back to nature.\n\nAs the lake is stream fed, there is no need to worry about losing depths. The water quality is superb, with plenty of natural food resources, although we have been supplementing our fish with other nutrients in order to increase their growth prior to opening.\n\nOur stunning specimens of Carp, a mixture of mirrors and commons, range from 20lbs to 50lbs, most were in excess of 30lbs to 38lbs in 2004 when newly stocked. They have now grown considerably, and our best recorded catch was in June 2005, weighing in at 48.5lb. In 2006, we will be continuing our stocking programme by introducing in excess of 150 Carp (Mirrors and Commons) into the lake and stock pond.\n\nDuring 2005, we invited 24 angling friends to test out the lake for us. Overall, they caught 197 Carp, which is an average of 8.2 per person. There were 114 30's, with 36 over 35lbs, and 8 over 40lbs. There are 9 swims on the lake, accessible from all sides. We have decided not to permit more than 6 anglers on the lake at any one time. We believe in allowing each angler a larger area to themselves in which to fish, therefore enhancing the quality of your fishing holiday.\n\n2005 was a year of much hard work and preparation to get our business on track for opening in 2006. We have recently had our 1 1/4 acre stock pond excavated to a depth of 5-8' in order for us to produce our own stock fish in the future.\n\nStock:CArp ranging from 20 to 50lbs\n\nIf you are flying, see Links for Ryanair and Flybe, both of whom have regular flights to Limoges.

Under the surface the lakebed has patches of silt and is relatively snag free, the rest of the lakebed is made up of bars, troughs and holes again all ideal hotspots and target areas for searching out your quarry.\n\nMuch thought has gone into the swims to give each angler a host of features and also so you don’t encroach onto neighbouring swims, there are 9 swims in total on the lake but we don’t wish the lake to be over crowded and prefer to keep it to a maximum of 7 anglers at anyone time, so there is plenty of room for you all to move around. The swims have all been designed and arranged to offer you plenty of space and comfort, most of the swims will allow you to pitch even the biggest of bivvies, swim 4 has been made into a double swim should you wish to have a social fishing trip.\n\nStock:Lac Serenity is home to good head of hard fighting top quality specimen Mirrors with starburst scale patterns and Commons that shine like bars of gold up to a weight of 48.09lb and by the time you arrive, if the fish continue to put on weight as they are doing at the moment, there is a possibility there could be fish to 50+ in the lake.\n\nTo further compliment the fishing and to offer something different, we also have a few Catfish to vary your fishing techniques.\n\nThe Lac Serenity fish have seen very little angling pressure and as such have gained weight since their original stocking and have spawned several times so during the winter period, the lake has been drained down and the smaller fish have been removed and the hand picked selected ones have been added into our stock pond and grown on for future stockings, We have also added a further 120 carp ranging in weight from 20lb up to 44lb+. You can be assured that the fish at Lac Serenity are of a very high quality, and will fight hard and long all the way to the net.\n\nThe fish in our lake are all in immaculate condition due to a high nutritional pellet, which has been fed to them since they were first stocked, the feeding program will continue throughout the year, we do this to ensure that our stock are able to gain growth and to retain condition & stamina.\n\nFacilities:Adjacent to the lake is the Fisherman’s lodge, which is available to all of our guests 24 hrs a day. Inside you will find shower and toilet facilities and sinks with plenty of hot running water whenever you require it.\n\nAlso for your use is a 4 ring gas hob and microwave and fridge/freezer for storing all your supplies, the kitchen is well supplied with pots & pans and crockery should you prefer to cook your own meals and not take advantage of our freshly produced home cooked food. For those taking advantage of our food package, meals will be served looking out over the lake or inside the lodge should the weather be against us.\n\nWhilst taking a break from the fishing, the lodge is also equipped with English TV so catching up with events back home is easy or if you fancy a game a pool we have a full size table for your use. The lodge also has plenty of sockets for charging your bait boats, phones or camera batteries.\n\nWe are also able to offer our guests a meal package; all the food is freshly prepared and will satisfy the biggest of appetites.\n\nBooking information:http://www.lacserenity.com/price.html",

This 6 acre, family run fishery is managed by a highly respected carp angler, nestling in a quiet, rural setting, where it is not unusual to hear only the sound of a distant tractor, whilst relaxing behind a set of carp rods.",
    "description": "Lagune Lassi is not runs water but is a carp lake, where the serious angler is well rewarded with the possibility of catching from a stock of sturgeon, carp up to 56lb and catfish up to approx 100lb!\n\nThe lake has no crayfish or poisson chat. The water is usually slightly coloured and the depth averages 12' 00'' in early season dropping to about 10' 00'' in late summer. The lake bed is firm, sandy gravel, with a few interesting features. There are one or two small weed beds present but these cause no problem to the angler.\n\nDespite these 'carrieres' (the French name for sand and gravel lakes) being relatively young, Lassi is completely tree lined and wasn’t fished until 2002! There are 2 double-swims, the Laurels and the Lodge. There are also 4 single swims, and a corner of the lake which is completely overgrown with no swims. 2 of the single swims (Bar & Poplars) are only suitable for single bivvy’s. The amount of anglers is limited to a maximum of five. Disabled access is only possible to the lodge swim and access to the 4 single swims requires more effort, but wheel barrows are provided\n\nThe carp are mainly deep-bodied mirrors with high shoulders, huge mouths and big fins! There is also a sprinkling of commons of similar shape. Stock levels are reasonably high ensuring relatively easy-fishing. Everyone that visits Lagune Lassi including those with only a little carp experience, should easily catch its leviathans.",

In heatwaves, you will very often see fish at the surface of the lake around the island.\n\nI discovered this lake around 3 years ago and the carp stock was already more than satisfactory.

There are magnificent Common Carp, well-scaled and some of up to 19kg (41lbs).\n\nOpposite the lake, less than 30 metres away, you will find a beautiful building where you can stay. The lake is in full view of the windows and only the noise of the fish will wake you!\n\nThis is an absolutely charming spot where you can thoroughly enjoy yourself.\n\nThe spacious bedrooms are tastefully decorated and each has a private bathroom. On the ground floor is a spacious and smart living room. Finally, for dining, you have the choice between an equipped kitchen and the garden area with barbecue.",

During the last few years, Mr. Dollat (Mayor of Perigny la Rose) with his team have refurnished this pit and made all the banks available for fishing. The lake is totally secured with a fence covering the full 15 acres of land. There is a track that goes all around the perimeter. The swims are well spaced out, with grassy areas for bivvies and rods. The banks are very smooth, which give you the opportunity to fish anywhere you like.\n\nThe lake bed, in true gravel pit style, is anything but flat with gravel bars, deep holes and plateaus all over the place. Bait boats are allowed on this venue and could be an advantage for precise baiting and presentation. There is not a lot of weed - a big head of grass carp do a good job at keeping it at bay.\n\nStock: The lake has a very big head of carp that was stocked bi-annually by the mayor of Périgny la Rose until 2008. One of the nice things about the venue is the high proportion of commons present - the lake record common stands at 46lb.The average size is between 23lb - 32lb, with mirrors over 45lb having been banked. There is a very healthy head of thirty-pound carp.",

Well 2006, 2007 & 2008 was no different and the fantastic catch reports kept rolling in.\n\nThe lake is a 34 year old virgin gravel pit set in the heart of the beautiful Pays de la Loire countryside.

The lake is fenced and tree lined making it totally private - it has been left as natural as possible giving a real feel of seclusion.\n\nStock: Laroussi was not open to the public in the first 33 years it existed, giving the original stock fish plenty of time to mature - it now offers exceptional big carp fishing. Most of the carp are between 30lb and 40lb, with more than 30 different forties, 13 different fifties, 3 sixties of 61lb, 64lb, 65lb and a huge 75lb 2oz, the current lake record.",

In contrast to the majority of venues in this part of Brittany, which are typically of only 2 to 5 acres in size, Le Beau Lacs is a much larger, mature lake that dates back over 300 years - it's a beautiful 27 acre, lily fringed water set in the rolling countryside of Ile et Vilaine. It was originally created in the early 1700's and is surrounded by oak and poplar trees that are themselves hundreds of years old. The venue is open to a maximum of ten anglers but is also suitable for groups of four or five anglers when offered for exclusive bookings. Le Beau Lacs has English owners, Ian Muir and Geoff Ward. They purchased the property in 2004 and have since stocked it with common and mirror carp to 30lb+. Geoff and Ian are both keen carp anglers, Geoff having run a tackle shop in the UK... both will be only too pleased to assist visiting fishermen.\n\nStock:Approx 300 commons and mirrors, to 44lb, catfish to 20lb and some koi. Plus a good original stock to 40lb+\n\nFacilities:There's a shower and toilet facility outside the main house which is for anglers use. Full food package available (please ask for details). Also available: lunch, beverages, batteries, gas canisters, end tackle & bollies. Delivered to your swim throughout the day via the walkie talkie's supplied for each swim.",

    "description": "Description:If you are looking for a carp fishing venue with something to offer everyone then why not stay at Le Chene Vert. Our 5 acre carp lake is set in 5 acres of private parkland and woods. The lake is stocked with mirror carp and common carp to 45lbs and is ideal for both experienced and novice anglers, while our facilities make it an excellent choice for families, and mixed groups.\n\nStock:The lake is fed by 3 springs which ensures a constant level and excellent water quality all year round. The bottom is made up of sand and clay and has a layer of leaf mulch, grass carp ensure we have no weeds to cause snags.\n\nThe average depth is 2m, though this shallows out to 1m around some of the margins providing a shelf where the carp like to cruise, and deepens to 3 1/2m in 2 large holes towards the centre. Several old oak trees on the banks provide cover without impeding the fishing while natural contours in the bank provide ideal features to fish to.\n\nThis winter we are working on digging in a new swim at the top end of the lake which will open up a previously inaccessible area of the lake giving our anglers a greater choice. The lake is limited to 6 anglers with a choice of 8 swims 2 of which are doubles.\n\nThe lake was stocked in 2006 with carp to 40lb, and from what we have seen of these over the last year they certainly seem to be piling on the pounds.\n\nWe have a high percentage of mirrors and commons in the mid to high 20’s, with a good stock of 30lb +. All of our guests have commented on the colours and quality of the carp they have caught not to mention their good fighting ability!\n\nWe also have roach, chub, perch, grass carp and tench and most importantly no poisson chats!\n\nFacilities:Le Chene Vert is a drive and survive venue and welcomes both anglers and non-angling guests. Children under 12 are also welcome on exclusive lake hire.\n\nOur facilities include a 6 berth bunk chalet (16m sq) for those not wishing to bivvy up, English toilet and shower, large covered “Abri” for cooking, washing up and dining, (with power point and drinking water). You will also find a fridge and freezer for bait and grocery storage. Around the grounds you will also find barbeque facilities with picnic benches, large floodlit multi use sports pitch for 5 a side, badminton and volley ball. You are also welcome to use our 8m swimming pool (subject to season).\n\nThe Abri and toilet/shower facilities are approx 2 minutes walk from the furthest swim.\n\nThere is a secure hard standing car parking for 6 vehicles and vehicle lake side access for 4 of the swims.\n\nThe surrounding area has much to offer in the way of attractions and shopping facilities. The nearest bar and restaurant are less than 10 minutes walk from the gates. The restaurant comes highly recommended and can also offer bed and breakfast accommodation.\n\nBread and groceries can be bought in one of the nerby villages (approx 5 km ), and there is a pizza takeaway aprrox 5 minutes drive.",

There are 6 swims (max 4 anglers) with easy, mown walking access all round the carefully maintained 2 acre lake which also has a picturesque island that can be reached by a small bridge. Catch carp up to 40lbs plus grass carp and decent-sized tench and roach in relaxing tranquillity while watching the woodpeckers, kingfishers and red squirrels.\n\nFacilities: There are really very few places in France with a gem of a set up like this.

    "description": "Stock: The carp stock amounts to around 500 documented fish ranging from 20's to high 40's with our first 50's due in 2010. The carp are supplemented by catfish up to 80lb mark and a few sturgeon. The fish are all in superb condition and have a reputation for their power and stamina. Being young fish growth rates are proving to be at the top end of expectations and we enjo average increases of at least 5lb per annum with individual carp putting on up to 10lb per year.",

    "description": "Description: The Le Queroy lakes date back hundreds of years and when we first moved to the property centuries of silt was suffocating the waters, stunting the growth of the fish. Over the next two years we cleared the silt and revitalised the waters. We then re-introduced the best of the strains - rare long-bodied mirrors with the most amazing scale formations, a silver strained variety and finally a golden bellied deep bodied Italian strain.\n\nStock: Most of the fish in the main lake are 30 - 45 lbs (mirrors, leather and common carp) but there are some mirrors to nearly 50 lbs. There are also 14 grass carp to 40 lbs. These are fast, powerful fish to land. There is one catfish of around 80lbs. The lake covers some 5 acres and is 3.25 metres at its deepest point. There are 8 swims and three of these can comfortably take two bivvies. A second smaller lake of 1.25 acres currently contains a handful of specimen carp to almost 60lbs and one 40lb catfish. We have also a new larger lake which has been stocked but which is not open yet for fishing.",
